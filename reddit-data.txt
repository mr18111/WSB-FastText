Prepare your bowels.. Just hit $21.
BBBY bringing my net worth to what my wife thinks it is ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
How do you convince her your cock is as long as you say it is? A European tape measure and she doesn't know the difference between inches and millimeters? Or she's never seen it yet?
Get off the treadmill cuz I gotta shit bad and run to the gym bathroom. Mid-shit my smart watch says out loud “HEART RATE: ONE-HUNDRED-SIXY-THREE BEATS PER MINUTE” and dude in the next stall bursts out laughing
Dude in the next stall had the same issue
Another day passing on avocado toast to buy one share of BBBY
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.
BBBY...ahhh...you guys are able to zoom.out past the 1day right? Gonna be just fine.
If you’re gonna flip a tit because a meme stock went down 50 cents in premarket, then your regarded ass shouldn’t be playing them in the first place lol
I’m regarded. Regarded as a retard.

I would honestly have ended it tbqh. the sheer rage would have done me in otherwise
Same here he would have made soo much watermelon 🍉 money falling like rain 🌧

WSB: well you see, there’s this guy and this watermelon…
Yall remember that movie with Adam Sandler where he goes to Bed Bath & Beyond to get a remote?
Oh shit all in!
🚫🧢
Adam Sandler's Click is such a strange movie.  It's a typical Adam Sandler comedy for 90% of it. It lulls you into false sense of security as you watch a dog hump a stuffed animal, Adam Sandler making funny voices, etc etc. You lean back and are pretty comfortable watching this pretty sub par movie. Then wham! out of nowhere the movie punches you in the mouth. Adam Sandler is crying and begging for a second chance at life in the parking lot of a bed bath and beyond. I cried so hard right with him

And for that reason... All in BBBY
Click! Great movie
KEEP HOLDING BBBY WITH YOUR DIAMOND HANDS!!  It will keep 🚀 if you just hold! 💎🙌🏼
Walmart:  we expect to see lower revenue due to macroeconomic conditions and are confirming lower guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year

Also Walmart:  just kidding - discounts driving demand - thanks for the cheaper shares!
cant believe bears bought puts but i let them get to me i was gonna buy 3-5 calls only bought 1 $137 but i’m fine with it. Better safe then sorry. Just don’t know if i should chase with target calls since it’s already pumped some following walmart.
Almost like hey we were desperate to move products so cut prices. Don't get used to it tho because we will probably raise prices later. Then be like inflation did this lol
Share holders demand tooling growth, can’t roll back those prices any longer!
I took out a loan to buy Walmart 135 calls 

Hold me
Post gain porn later pls
Send er bud
*literally went up 3 dollars yesterday* 

*goes down 20 cents* 

HAHHAA BULLS FUKT.

CNBC comparing BBBY to GME and AMC on a chart and accidentally use Best Buy instead. Bullish.
Bby about to get a pump
I accidentally checked BBY the other day and almost poked my eye out with my boner before realizing I was looking at Best Buy.
Oh.. this is happening! BBBY
Walmart and HD beat.

Let the rally continue!  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
HD down tho
Stay on $TGT
Walmart flat
It’s up 3.5%. You’re an idiot
They cut, then beat the cut. They really didn't beat
It's PM with low volume. Let everyone wake up and actually be able to participate.
Soft landing achieved! JPOW pulled it off so now BBBY can go to $1k. Thanks JPOW
dear BBBY thanks for making me 6k in 57minutes
I swear if i get back over 40k i wont blow it again![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Do you promise?

Wow me too. Sold my VTI for BBBY so this shit better land lol
I already lost money tomorrow
So WTF was Walmart warning about the other month when they tanked??  Now suddenly  they are raising guidance?  Hmmm, not sus at all
Even they aren't optimistic in their report.

"The retailer's results surpassed analysts' expectations, but echoed its profit warning last month, when Walmart said inflation-pinched shoppers were buying less high-margin discretionary merchandise like apparel as they spent more on necessities. 

Walmart reiterated its forecast for the back half of the year. It expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to grow by about 3%, excluding fuel, for the second half of the year, or about 4% for the full year. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will decline between 9% and 11% for the full year."
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

YOLOd into BBBY. FOMO is a hell of a drug
imagine if you are 27k paperhand guy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
At 21$ I no longer have student loan debt... I love you guys
That would require you to sell at $21

Are we all in agreement?
Melonlingus ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If you’re wondering why BBBY is down premarket for the first time in ages, the reason is quite simple. Yesterday I bought 600 shares at 16. The rally is over. I’m sorry guys.
You sound like the type that is going to get out when it drops to 14, and then get back in at 25
That’s what I did already. Bought at 11, sold when it dropped to 9. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Let us know when you sell so we can jump back in
Or cause it went up 20% yesterday
🥶
or be cause fibonacci says resistance at 17
What’s fibanocci?
what tf happpened to this sub is the real question
Need to turn these $15 into $10000 by tomorrow

Yes.
I think it would have reached 20k

Absolutely

It ain’t a squeeze until we see circuit breakers.
BBBY was at 27 in march
Fuck inflation my bag of chips cost 10% more !

***proceeds to dump entire pay check In a single trade***
164m volume on Bobby yesterday can we do 200 today ? I may want to exercise my 14c’s

Im holding till tomorrow. Sadly if I do one more day trade I’ll be marked as a PTD 😮‍💨 and get flagged
Premarket tricked the bbby bears 😂😂😂
17 was too easy put some more weight on the bar
Another missed opportunity for me with BBBY. Been seeing it since high 6s and didn’t do anything. Sigh.
It's never too late to buy long dated puts on that trash.
It's only missed if you don't buy in now. Then you can buy in now, hit the top and see the rug pulled from under you.

Don't miss out on BB 2.0
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take
it’s not over
Buy we are all going to the moon brother fomo isnt real
Same, but I bought at 15, this goes at least to 80
Not too late. Just bought
You didn't miss anything. You don't have to listen to me for no reason but just look at the fucking volume. That's the only indicator you need.
Never too late my guy. People were saying the same thing at 14 last Friday. Look where we are now.
Its not over yet.
I remember the days of staring at GME at $20s and finally fomoing at $40s…. Not this time BBBY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I’m actually regarded
My wife walked in to me sitting naked at the computer furiously jacking off. She walks over to see what I’m staring at and sees the candlesticks. 

She simply walks out of the room and yells from the end of the hallway “THIS is why I visit my boyfriend!”
Did you finish though? Don't leave us hanging
Hahahah, u could invite her to enjoy some candle porn with you. A scented candle and u can enjoy her old soggy body while getting hard from those candle

Walmart beating earnings was so obvious
Only wish I got much more calls. At least I got some
About to have crawled back from a 30k deficit and be in profit in a record setting 7 days.
I would sell cause it will not last
100% will be all cash except about 7k in long dated spy puts by EOD. Will go case by case after that. This is "euphoria" and Burry is never wrong except on timing.
Cool. Now do it again.

This is all still one big dip. $80 here we come!!!

Bbby 17 lets go
Well just jumped in BBBY.
I actually can't imagine why anyone would sell right now. This is so obviously going off
Its only up 6.5% today. Way less than 50%. Besrish.

Just testing the nipple. Gonna bust right through the damn wall imminently. Cows are tasty
Bounced hard off it, gonna consolidate and retest

Always get a prenup. Divorce rate is 50%. Terrible ROI
But did I mention her name's Melinda *ates?
I call BS
You'd be correct
At least hedge with some CC's.  


(Cide chicks)
Only CCs I sell are WKHS, trying to bring my cost basis down to something she wouldn't divorce me over immediately if she found out
Hey don't worry, girls LOVE expensive bags.
Thinking about how many Louis Vuittons I could have bought with my losses does make me a little queasy
Congrats dude! Good luck!
Muchas gracias!

See that Wendy's drive through over yonder?
Skip the pre-nup if she has more money than you.

The dip is cancelled
BBBY shorts fighting so hard to bring price down. Yolo margin and yolo shares
It's not shorts. It's people cashing in their profits
Nobody puts BBBY in the corner
BBBY just fueled up
Jacked to the tits on BBBY
BBBY hitting the top of the yearly downtrend. A strong break above $17 could push it to over $20 by the end of the day.
Santa Clause could become President too!
In this environment he probably could tbh
We go to $20 today! And pass AMC tomorrow 😆
BBBY about to be the #1 in volume in a few minutes
So 18 is the magic number on BBBY
yesterday it was 15 👍

Take what you learned from GME and apply it here.
Hold for 20 months, got it
That 90% of people will hold bags for years to come?
And then apply it back to GME
I did it boys. 100% gains so far. Keep going!
1000% on my BBBY calls lmaooo
WMT earnings are going to move the market up or down more than CPI did. 😜

/u/BullishToTheMoon23 (1W/0L) made a bet that BBBY would go to 20.0 when it was 15.0 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
BBBY has $7B in revenues, but only 1.5B mkt cap.
Why do I have 600 share only of BBBy at an average of 16?
Spy literally can’t go down
Like my ex-wife on me.
Every sell off is a fucking bear trap
Market taking advantage of people’s ptsd. That’s why we win, we have no fear because we have frontal lobe damage ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Literally sitting at my desk at work, making a pay check every half hour
What an epic squeeze. Holy fuck.

If you're not playing BBBY, what the hell are you doing?

All my funds are unsettled.
Holy moly
$25 the next goal then moon 🚀🚀🚀

BBBY single handedly undoing two years of my bad decisions.
Underrated comment
Whale incoming my wife’s buying BBBY at open

She’s not rich but she is thicc
Thicc in the head for not waiting for the 10:15-11am dip.
Who is coming in your wife?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
👻
my guess is BBBY to 20 by EOD
Good odds it 3x’s in a single day this week.
$0.20 maybe
Can we just get a BBBY megathread?
Even yo mama got a megathread…
Lol you sound just like your dad
Fuck

We like spy at 500 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Its funny how random bears are born over night on these meme stocks.
Just a little bit of consolidation. Pretty normal. Stock is still gonna rip today.
RSI can suck my dick, means nothing in this 🤡 market
Honestly VISUALMODS financial headlines are the best news source around. No nonsense, just facts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
I love how SPY has started scheduling it’s dips during non-trading hours.

No red days forever

$bbby another 170m volume day ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Am i glitching or did bbby just go up 5% on one candle
Was in shock seeing it
The funniest part about meme stock shorts is some (non-ape) experts have pointed out that the shorts getting fucked are frequently retail shorts. It actually makes sense when you look at all the salty holier than thou comments about “puts on bbby”. Like when gme was ripping there were regular boomers shorting and buying puts and getting their face ripped off ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
[removed]
Exactly, which is why it doesn’t work with stuff like amc gme bbby where they’re not running on fundamentals, but rather pumpamentals 🚀🚀🚀
How do you explain to someone that you lost all your money buying something that tends to expire worthless and not sound retarded?
Tell it to my vegetable crisper
Same as booze and every non-weirdo drinks.
Open the casino
BBBY 🚀
Get in now before they turn the buy button off again
I feel we underestimate why it happened, why it had to be stopped, but I hope it will never happen again because I need this to go to the moon and beyond
bought  200 @ 16.88
Positions or ban
Congratulations
My BBBY is green but the rest of my account is bleeding.
Keep shorting bobby and find out what happens mane
Sorry guys. I just FOMO’d and bought a single share of BBBY so the top is in.
#$4 AWAY FROM MELON KUNIS
If you’re waiting to buy the dip, this is it
When will my BaBBY hit 18
it will stop between 16.54 and 16.78. Good luck.
Wow, so accurate
BBBY breaks out of 17 today !
Id cum
Cum now bb!
I’m in BBBY for the technology
BBBY are we ripping dad?
#My melon senses are tingling.
Fk it, went from 7k to 17k on bbby options, locking in all the profits and converting to shares
shout out to the absolute retards who told everyone to buy under $8
I just sold everything to buy more BBBY. 3K Shares to Pluto.
20 ain't a stop.  There are a ton of 20C weeklies.  When those go ITM that's when the real boosters kick in
Bby is at 83 I think I bought the wrong one
I mean you may not of made a good buy but you definitely made the Best Buy
all those BBBY bears getting rekt and I love every minute of it
FUN FACT: BUYING MORE SHARES = HIGHER STOCK PRICE 😉
When HIGH STOCK PRICE, we will sell it. smart bro
[removed]
This is the way
I sold my entire diversified portfolio in order to stock up on BBBY, scared money don’t make money
Jill Biden Covid positive- incredibly bullish sign.
She’s a doctor she’ll be fine

did you get down on the ground and roughhouse at least before s/he dropped that knowledge? was the dog a good boy or girl?
After we sniffed each others butts, I was able to see a sausage between his legs.
IT BLASTED THROUGH $18 LIKE THAT GUY’S DICK WILL BLAST THROUGH THAT WATERMELON
There are people actually talking about Tesla here? LAWL
Warming the seats before the indictment
This is actually absurd. Never thought I would be buying at $18.
Quit rimming my butthole BBBY, just go already!
Just a reminder melon fucking at 20$

Doesn’t matter if i hold the bag, but i want to see some melon porn.
I am ready to see him fuck a melon today
Can’t wait foe the show. Tomorrow we reach $20 fam
Maybe tonight lol hhahaha
It’s not huge but I’ve exercised 1,000 shares worth of BBBY at $15 to help the cause.  Another 1,500 shares being exercised throughout the day.
my man
Whoever said $20 EOD was lying. We going $20 EOH 🚀🚀
END OF THIS HALF HOUR YOU MEAN GEEZ
My ape brain can’t read a clock
$BBBY hitting $20 is going to be the cable cutter that cuts the cable on this elevator ride.
Why? Why not 10 or 15? We’re going to the moon baby
I am starting to feel the FOMO now lol
Not too late

The last squeeze got fucked up because people sold their contracts. Actually exercise those calls for a real short squeeze and money beyond your wildest dreams!
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Nobody is exercising calls with like 400% iv and losing thousands to lost theta time on a Tuesday
Nice try JPM. If I keep rolling to slightly ITM calls I do 10x the damage
I’m cool with that!
You realize some people don’t have the money to exercise, right?
You realize there is a “sell to exercise” option right?
$27 eod BBBY🍉🍉🍉🍉
If you consider selling BBBY because you feel like the thesis of 

1. Heavy short float
2. Larger experienced meme group
3. More capital on meme traders 
4. No buy button disable 
5. GME peaked close to 25B market cap, BBBY is at 1.5B~

So do you want to sell? what other investing thesis do you have that beats this? The risk/reward potential for BBBY is 🔥🔥🔥
Just bought another 270 at 18.8 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)

Lol fr
It seemed like every time he posted that shit, the market turned around and went green. So I am thinking it is bearish.
Plot twist: it’s jpow’s alt account
Michael Burry selling
So?
A more bullish signal
I see, I’m guessing as a result of that you hold puts/went cash gang?
so bbby Is what, gonna fall at open to 14.50s then rebound and moonshot to a new high of 18.62 by later today afternoon 

seen this before, hold, buy more during the dip, grow a pair of nuggets

How low spy dipping and why do u think red
I think Burry selling everything in Q2 is huge but it's really getting downplayed right now. Christian Bale is probably going to get recast for the big short 2.
Shill-bots destroying banter
The idea that some people are just "theta gang" baffles me. Play theta-positive strategies when volatility is elevated and expected to fall — sure. It's a *useful tool*. But trying to be theta gang and use premium collection strategies for *every market environment* is like trying to pound a nail with a circular saw.

You need to use the right tool for the job — you need to use the right option strategy for the trading environment.
The only certainty is that we will all decay into nothing.
You can't think of *any* other certainties?
I honestly believe those strategies can only successfully work if you have been engaged in trading for atleast 5 to 8 years. Although I constantly find my self recommending people use their premium from selling calls to buy puts.
IMO it isn't *that* hard to use teach someone the proper circumstances to benefit from these strategies — it's just that no fund is **just theta gang**. There's a reason - because that's dumb. There are **plenty of funds**, however, that work in volatility arbitration. That requires *some* premium collection & theta gang, and *some* long-volatility & high delta trades — analyzing the environment and picking the best strategy is what generates alpha - not being *the best* at premium collection trading.
It’s not hard to teach but it’s like they refuse to believe they can not just hedge but actually profit on the downside. I always wondered if it was willful ignorance or just fear

I guess Walmart already posted pwnage? Nice
Pwnage- I feel like I’m back in 2006 over here
I feel the turd brewing. Just in time for market open I’m sure it’s funny how that tends to happen now. I think the excitement plays a role in it. Nervous poops

If you know these details you must be a bagger there. 😂

Borrow fee at 53.3% for BBBY

Yowza 🤯
Some brokers as low as 12% tho
Now divide by 365
I’m just pointing out that it’s already quite high. The fact that it has been rising indicates that the price movement has NOT been shorts covering. Instead they are continuing to dig themselves deeper.
If I click your profile how many ape tickers am I gonna see?

They ded, covered their positions after cramer said shorts were crazy to short this stock

BBBY volume is absolutely bonkers
It's like at seven figures every 20 seconds
So is the options chain, its 74% bullish.
Give me tendies or give me death
Death it is
Dad pls have some hope ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Im gonna be honest. No idea what it does from here. Could BBBY hit $100? Absolutely. I don’t see shorts covering yet. 

But these fuckers are masterminds of manipulation so we’ll see.
$80 Is the pt for now
#MELON KUNIS IS CUMMING
Maybe we need to do more things like this, if I were a hedgie I’d run stocks just to see plebs fulfill disgusting banbets.
Bbby hitting $20 today yeaaaaaahh!!!!! Yeah!!!! Yeah!!!!!! Yeah!!!!!!!!! Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryan Cohen bought BBBY options contracts with 60c, 70c and 80c strikes…
Might fomo back in....fuck it
Battle of 18 lets go bbby
if 18 get broken, 20 is not a meme
What the fuck is up with bbby. I guess I’ll just have to buy that fuckin shit smh. I added 9/16 10c on 7/31 now that’s up 3,600%!! I feel like a fool. Fuck it I’m fomoing
All in on bbby it’s time

Days like today are when retarded millionaires are made
a fleet of lambos will be bought and crashed in the same week
Wow, nearly made back everything back from my 40k losses of puts hahahaha. Keep going bbby!
BUY THE DIP
I don’t even have skin in the game, but seeing BBBY go off is fun to watch. I’ll be honest, almost got 1,000 at sub$5 last month, but put into GME for the long haul. Would be up $15k right now instead of $4k. Enjoy those gains BBBY Bulls!
Selling at $20.50? No thank you
this may be my first time on the right side of market history
Still thinking about the 27k loan guy. You could have been a legend. Now you will only be remembered as the 27k loan guy to me 🤷‍♂️
Literally just put his stop loss a little lower and he would have been fine. R.i.p the dream to that guy
My mum says we can buy BBBY shares if it’s okay with your mum.
Alright i'm convinced bbby is gonna squeeze somewhere to triple digits and some HF is gonna go bankrupt and it's gonna be hilarious lmao
quick rest stop before $30
market used CRASH to stop BBBY

it was not effective
lol imagine selling at 20
Buy the dip
I keep buying every dip I see until it hits 40
Get rich or die trying
The fact my calls from last week are up over 380% and I'm not even thinking about selling shows me I belong here with you retards and deserve it to expire worthless
Dont let it get to your head
I had 20 x 10c expiration September and I sold half for locking in some gains at only 500%. Almost regretting it because the rest of them are sitting at 1500% gains
Market is done except for meme
whoever said to buy SNAP calls, well that was a fuckin lie.
Around $50 the non believers will figure out this isn’t like the sixth Wish attempt 💶
And that’s when they’ll buy in… and when it goes down they’ll call us bag holders.  😂

Ah flashbacks to GME squeeze.  Someone is going to buy at the top at some point though.
i might jump off a bridge into a pit of molten lava for missing another meme stock
Did u miss it? All in $BBBY now
Did u miss it? All in $BBBY now
SEND IT SEND IT
The apes can only handle one ticker at a time
100% on BBBY in one week? Yup the squeeze has commenced
115million in volume. My tits are jacked 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I don’t even know how to act anymore tbh
First time I’m actually considering just buying the shares instead of selling the option
trust me
Lol my 8/19 $44 calls printing!!!
Same! We gonna gamma Thursday. Book it
I was actually going to open a position at 19. I looked at myself in the mirror like the fucking sheep that I am for being unwilling to hop on the train earlier and I just couldn't pull the trigger.

I guess I'll get in at $30 instead.
Get in now and you’ll see 30 in no time
Every mini dip is getting bought, 🐻 fucked
At this point you’d be silly not to buy a dip
$BBBY to the moon and i’m blazed off my ass at the same time, riding along with it. 

LETS GET REGARDED🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
$30 eod

My loan hit my bank account yesterday. I could consolidate my debt.

Or….
Can't believe you're even considering it. Buy a nice hooker first for fitty bucks and eat his/her ass then buy stocks
I’m prescribed anti depressants and benzos, the only time I feel is gambling 🥲
Even an ugly one charges more than fitty.
Inflation ?

We (the west) are living in more comfort and luxury than kings from pre-industrialized society.

Cars, paved roads, huge houses, running water, indoor plumbing, supercomputers on every desktop, free healthcare.

#But so far, we are underperforming last year by -31.2%.
Do you know how much a car or a supercomputer costed in pre-industrialized society? Maybe one or two could afford it.
There were no cars or computers in preindustrial society lol

This ain't a crash but I do have fresh puts.
Walmart earnings are up, but everyone is charging every purchase on a credit card.
Everyone isn’t you 


But yes I generally do. Ain’t got this nice CC for nothing. Never spend $ you don’t have though, pay it off in full each time, treat it like a debit card. Boom freebies
I use cc for the travel miles and I pay off my cc every Friday. Next month I’m going to Hawaii for 10 days with wife and kid. We pay our hotel and flights with travel miles.

Friendly reminder if you weren’t here for GME.

We haven’t seen shit yet with BBBY. Pull your balls out of your stomach and hold.
This.
I suspect bbby closes around +100% today
All the doubters it’s not too late to jump in for the ride
Small dip then pump at open to green
Oink 🐷
BBBY can easily fix their balance sheet if they have a clearance sale on summer shorts.
At this point, there are gonna be loaded with liquidity if bbby pumps like how amc went from bankrupted to loaded
Is yahoo finance glitching
i saw it on webull
Etrade Pro just glitched too, so must have been some kind of mass market glitch.

BBBY just went from 16.05 to 14.50 in like 1/2 of a second, and then bounced all around the 15's, before finally figuring it out.
TD the same. Shit is about to get hilarious
atleast we all stare at the screen without blinking

Come on Bobby you can do it
Pave the way put your back into it
I said it last Tuesday and I'll say it again.  If you're in BBBY because you think it will hit 80 by January then dips like this should tickle you pink.  This is when you double down
[removed]
Tons of 1200 share orders popping in and inching the price back up
I really hope BBBY dips at open so we can all buy more
Hah you wish
Gjob BBBY bois

BUY SHARES THIS IS THEIR LAST STAND
There’s literally an entity following me around to make sure I stay poor.  SPY pumps the brakes the instant I buy even a modest call position
Stay away from options you tard
It’s the only hope I got regardless
Next time don’t buy calls after 6 straight weeks of green
Yeah it's the game master, shit is rigged
they must really be scared of 17, lol

Yes.  The shorts are getting shortier and the watermelon crew is getting hungrier.
 Now that’s some DD I can get behind
ahh yes nothing like basing your next move by asking the intellectuals in the daily thread
Yes
You should get what you have faith in, but yes.
Yes because I was the price to keep going up so I can profit

Ride or die fuckers 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
1 question regarding BBBY - Lot of Fomo is because of RC calls in Jan. My question is even if the stock goes upto $100 even then he cannot exercise his calls currently. Is my understanding correct?
He can exercise anytime he wants before his expiration date on the calls.  Not that you would, but you could also exercise them if he’s OTM if he wanted to pay more.
Yeah but at the moment he cannot get any shares from exercising/ selling these call options.
~~you can only exercise calls at the date.~~ Selling is possible anytime.

Edit: I was wrong. You can even exercise before. Funny and probably useless but if you can you can.
Don’t talk about things you don’t understand
That's for European options like SPX, American options can be exercised at any time even if OTM.
Really? As in getting the shares to the aforementioned price. Didnt know that.
Yep, your broker will warn you but legally they can't stop you.
Thanks for that!
Thanks, this was really helpful
You can exercise whenever you want
Incorrect
Yeah but the whole point is him getting all those shares by exercising the call options and hence squeezing the short sellers. Since he cannot do that, then the point of him having calls in Jan is moot for the current rally

Pretty accurate ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I remember the hodlers will they think of me
Corn been flirting with green all morning 🫡
Dudes be hoping bbby can go down just so they can buy in lower pps. Yeah that makes sense 🤔
If wmt pushes to 150 I'm buying bbby ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Everyday I'm deciding whether to go to the gym, eat chicken and brocoli or just play videogames and eat take out. I have no in between days.

So we got oil up, dollar up, yields up, stocks up this market legit makes no sense anymore I wonder what will break first? The trillion dollar bond market is going to collapse I think
When everything moves in tandem it scares the 💩 out of me
I'm not sure what but something stinks in this market really bad and I don't think I want to know the answer
I picture us sitting in a New York City sewer at 4am just waiting for the inevitable
With the manhole cover pushed above our heads to protect us? Once we survive the collapse of the financial system and the inevitable looting and chaos that will ensue above us we will rise from the rubble and visit central park with a free beer nabbed from an Irish bar fresh from the tap. 

With the world as our oyster and our puts printing tendies, we will start civilzation anew and collect common man and teach him new ways of thinking such as the art of being a bear and write poems of our legacy.

As the world took a hit

These bears sat in shit

As everyone went long

They just stroked their schlong

Tapping their fingers awaiting the crash

Like a 9/11 tower it printed them cash

The world in anarchy and toil

These bears rise like flowers in soil

The world needs new minds and perspective anew

We will teach you all of the chaos ensued.

Balls of steel man. Cash out and buy further calls to ensure profit? <random concerned internet guy>
Wonder if WMT updating it's guidance has anything to do with the upturn in consumer sentiment - just weeks ago it sounded disastrous and now they're seeing consumers eat higher prices and make more trips?
They had to lower costs to move extra products so seems to give an illusion of things getting better so better consumer confidence. Larger items like appliances nit moving as much. Seems like a mixed bag. If inflation comes back higher in the next month or so consumer confidence will drop again. Since Walmart released a statement before earnings about lower profits possible seems to be ralling after this earnings. My one put play dead lol
Yea I mean they basically lowered guidance and then "beat" that lowered guidance, and the stock is now actually *up* from where it was before it lowered guidance, and that's just illustrative of this entire earnings season
Pretty much. Any company that puts out any negative news before earnings just going to buy calls on now. Seems to be the new strategy I guess lol
don't forget about SNAP
Burry sold his Apple short yesterday.

Time for a drop
Why would you think that he sold his shorts yesterday out of all days in the previous quarter? Lol 🤦🏻‍♂️
Wait I'll go to ask him. He is outside mowing my lawn.

Holy fuck housing starts missed by -7% wow
I wish I knew how DASH is losing money.  They way overcharge for everything and every Becky is obsessed with it
Fellow degens that bought $WMT calls, you selling at open or letting this bitch ride for a bit?
I have 139 i need a little more pump.  Of course the market is red to put a damper on earnings
I’m holding 136c and think I’m going to just sell at open. Market is looking a little iffy this morning
Did you sell?
Yea, I did, about 10 min after market open. Looks like that was close to the top, at least as of right now. Got 122% return on my initial investment
Nicee i got out at 140 so about the same![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Good shit brother! Are you playing any other earnings this week?
I got a 1DTE spy call so if that profits probably.  You got any plays?
Nothing jumping out at me for the rest of this week. But we got $SNOW, $NVDA and $TSLA earnings next week, so I’m definitely throwing my hat in the ring for at least one of those
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

Someone yesterday said Walmart calls are free money, hope his favorite color lambo is in stock.
Calls are gonna be up maybe 50%, probably less.
I thought everyone at WSB was making million dollar trades?
Likely down since he probably bought $30 OTM calls
I don’t think WMT calls are going to be that big of winners. Im guessing the ATM options will make some money but not a ton

The king will reign! DKNG 🚀💰
I've got lucky on calls with them lately, I still have $25 Oct 21st expiry.
On October 21st the king will be worth $50 a share! On November 8th DKNG will be at ATH!!! These prices are amazing and I’m getting filthy rich of this beast.
It triggered my stop loss, now I have to wait for a good day as a entry point
Price just dropped from $15 to $13.95 in not even a second. Hmmmmm, seems normal
It's 15.22 right now.
buy on the dip --- plenty of volume awaiting the open
i think itll dip more after open and then start going back up again kinda like yesterday morning at least im hoping so i can get better discount
[removed]
now that its gone back up already i do not know
It’s nice of them to offer us a little discount before we get going
buckle up pony boy, were in for a  ride.
That’s a big candle
Why thank you

#Preparing thrusters

Every dip is being considered as the last chance to buy 😑
Every dip’s floor has been higher than the last
Watch this be the biggest pullback we’ll see on AAPL this week…
I think we see 178+ this week
and by pullback =  only negative between 930 and 1030 EST, followed by rocketing up to ATH by end of week.
I bought calls on the dip earlier, you might be in luck
Godspeed man. Buy high, sell even higher? Kind of what we’ve seen the pros do lol.
As long as it keeps going up, you still bought low. Stonks
OH NO STEPBRO IM STUCK IN THE DRYER AND NEED YOUR AUTISM

I GOTCHU BBBY
BBBY does whatever tf it wants and that BBBY wants some green shrek ogre cock

Bears think I care that BBBY is down 4% premarket. This just means I get a cheaper entry to buy more. This train has too much momentum.
Agree! Just heard on CNBC Ryan Cohen is bullish on BBBY let's go move over GME for the new kid in town
Guys it’s simple. 

Buy calls = make money

Buy puts = lose money
Pretty much
Fuck im going to fomo even more money into bbby

This place is infested with bots
We need Elon to clean it up
Exactly what a bot would say to hide in plain sight. 🤔
Bbby my nipples are erect!
What the fuck just happened? I Step away for 2 min and BBBY is hitting $18…
I swear if bbby goes to $50 by eow, Reddit can choose my fate
BBBY $100 EOW
It’s not a meme either
One of the things I love the most about this thread is reading posts from, what are clearly, the dumbest humans alive.

Makes you feel better about your life choices.
I felt better about my life choices the day I transported a guy to the hospital who decided to shoot up lemon Pledge in my ambulance
Fuck yeah
Damn bruh, didn’t have to call out the apes like that.
Honestly man if you need to come here to feel better about your life, it’s a huge red flag about your own mental health
You're the only one talking about 'need'.
Honestly man if you come to this sub to feel better about your life it’s a huge red flag for your own mental health

Looking forward to all the 'BBBY bagholder' jokes today.

They were funny two weeks ago when BBBY was $8. Even funnier last week when BBBY was $12. Will be hilarious next week.
It's not a joke though it's reality
It's called 'liquidity'.
For all the people saying buying BBBY isn’t “logical” you are right, it’s a gamble. But you don’t gamble on sports and casino using “logic” you gamble using TRENDS, GME and AMC proved that, BBBY follows that TREND, and that trend PAYS, it’s a fuck you to WS
But what part of the trend are we at now? Are we at the point when GME hit 400, or after where it stayed stagnant.
*Rafiki motions to water*
That’s part of the risk of a gamble, some people have high risk thresholds, it’s like putting together a +10000 parlay, do you cash out when you only have one leg to go, or do you go for the home run? I say you always go for the home run cause moderation is for cowards
yeah that TREND always ENDS with BAG HOLDERS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

“ItS 2o08 AlL oVEr AgAiN”. Sir this is Wendy’s in 2022.
$HD beat EPS by 1%. It has dropped $9 in PM but it’s probably low volume. Hopefully it’s a good rally week for retail!

Now we wait for Walmart…
How is HD down PM when it had such good earnings and guidance?
Have you seen this ER season thus far
The drop happened in PM with 1% of average daily volume traded so far. I believe that’s a low amount and won’t affect the price much. It’s probably just algos being algos. I guess a 1% EPS beat isn’t terribly inspiring. Still could be good news for short term macro. 

I would scoop up some $310 HD weekly calls immediately if the price remains below that at market open.
I think in this environment 1% beat is pretty good. Good enough to be green, but like you said just could be volume.

You sound far.. far too intelligent to be here.

Best you leave
Inflation at 9% and all these companies are saying “we set sales records up 7% above our prior high” as if that matters. It’s like a 17 game season nfl record vs a 12 game.
You should read into the earnings ... Inventory sold went down, but average cost of goods sold went up 9% (inflation) ... So a beat because of inflation, not because they actually had growth
God turned the power off in my area so I have no sell button today.

wallmarts a beat green day
Holding a ton of calls rn but I could honestly see it if we end up with a little red on the board today. Strong green for weeks ahead of tomorrow's Fed Minutes***
Thought FOMC doesn't do anything again til September. Did I miss something?
My bad I misspoke - fed minutes. It isn’t of huge importance but sometimes the market gets nervous before the release
I see. Maybe they'll signal their rate plans?
Fed minutes really just open up the curtain the committee members opinions from the last meeting. More like if a committee member was suddenly very hawkish, that could potentially be a market-negative. But generally we know what’s going on with them (or so we believe), so there shouldn’t be any huge surprises.
It's just a release of what ocurred last meeting. Nothing new
Yesterday the stop loss that I put on BBBY got triggered at 14.1€. My total profit was 2€ after fees. No regrets, profit is profit. I guess that's why they call us paperhanded europoors. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I agree ☝🏽. Profit is profit ……BUT you might really regret this! These mfrs have me fomoing hard like BBBY may REALLY pump
I got burned from a pump and dump before and I didn't want that to happen again. Also I was using margin so...nope.

Of course, watching all the gains I could have made will hurt but managing risk is very important when you play with money you can't afford to lose.
I agree 100% . Currently stuck with a few bags i shoulda never picked up![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Every bear shot, Every bear dead EBK
Okay, so can we let it drop a little at open so I can sell my puts and buy calls to Valhalla
Cramer in the nicest way possible is saying shorts are fuc 😂
No way WMT should be up on the guidance they gave, I’m gonna lose 50 fucking dollars
Sir, this is a casino. Put some real money in there
But that was his life savings bro...
Back to the Wendy’s dumpster
Same….
I suspect it’ll open high and come down again
This^
Oh no 50 whole dollars

What are these numbers? I never know.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Down 5% today, still up 6% this week🤑
WMT holding the same guidance from last earning is the definition of priced in. She's pumping today for sure.
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

My 140 calls wanna agree with you
I got a few $139 Friday calls and a grip of shares for long term let’s goooo. I like the safety of it in regards to recession and such
Years from now Bloomberg will be referencing this leg up, either talking about how it was the recovery or a bump on the way down lower.  L

I would love to know who is short volatility right now. Its someone with fuck tonnes of money and nobody is hedging with the vix anymore... probably alot of small/mid funds are going to get fucked by volatility soon. We had volmaggeddon for a reason and it feels like it might happen again

Anyone talking about mike burry selling off all his exchanges except for a [private prison](https://nypost.com/2022/08/15/michael-burry-dumps-stock-portfolio-after-market-crash-warnings/)?
It’s because he’s trying to be close with R. Kelly
He’s earlyyyy
That boy ain’t right
It just means we'll be green for another year cause he's always early. 

Confirmed by the yield curve.
He's a drama queen. Ignore him.
Regarding housing starts and permits…most permits have been waiting 9+ months before they’re issued in lots of places. Literally applied when housing was still hot. Issued permits are a dumb trailing metric.
Then wouldn’t a trailing metric from 9 months ago make the current number of housing permits requested today, even worse?🤔

Meaning in Mar 2023, I would expect less than 1M for permits
Probably…but remember, builders build. That’s all they know. They’ll overbuild every time. Honestly, I don’t think more pricey/low quality homes will fix the astronomical rent increases that are borderline criminal. There’s not a lot of places to build developments in some places, so no builder is going to build a 400k home when they can build a 650k one for a 100k more.
I definitely agree with that last part
It will become a crisis if HS drops under 1M.  People need houses and rents are out of control.  The Federal government will need to do something to fix it.
Yeah, this makes sense. I was bearish on the XHB 6 months ago and made a fair bit of money. Huge lagging indicator as we’ve only seen those permits go down. Wonder when it all comes to the point when builders go through a legitimate recession. I think the homebuilders market a much better bet than betting on the real estate market tanking.
All the easy land has been built on in a lot of places. I made a few trips recently into the permit department trying to see what was taking so long on my permit (incompetence in permit dept was the main issue), and I was the only person in there 2 out of 3 trips. I’m not going to be surprised to see dips in permits.
Maybe I should’ve held on to my SPY $428p after all

Bbbuy fkin bbby
You couldn’t force this down with a nuclear bomb the last couple weeks, guess who bought a call a few minutes ago.
Watching my TSLA puts go +20 to -30 and then back go even in the first 20 minutes
Yeah I saw the resistance up above 943 level and there are like 3 resistance levels above that before it can break to $1,000.  So I think today might be a consolidation day.  We might retrace back to 900 in the next couple of days.  I’m waiting it out.  Good luck on your puts.
im almost at a $100 profit, how exciting

Honest question - when this happens how much is it due to this sub?
Yes
GME was us idk if this is
Sir, this is a casino
I think that it happens at all is largely due to this sub, but when it runs like this it's just a mix of FOMOing normies and the mechanics of how covering/DCA'ing shorts works. They have to buy more shares to hope for profitability, or to close their short. Thus raising the price.
Not due to in the sense that we're some machivellian geniuses. We're just idiots who will sometimes jump in on insane gambles when someone spots a particularly vulnerable short position. But we're probably the largest, least exclusive, forum where those things get discussed.
So it's about mass, and not really strategy. I don't feel like BBBY grew on here as much as GME, AMC, or BB did, though. That felt more organic and people here just have come to recognize this kind of squeeze.

This is a healthy pull back for BBBY, just sets up for another massive surge
Dont lie, who shorted BBBY and got fucked?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
I had to rebuy my covered calls that got blown out of the water at every strike
The only way to ever lose on a covered call is to buy it back.
True but let's be honest, this thing is going to fly the rest of the week.
No position and still got fucked
I’m not long BBBY and I was a skeptic but I’m a believer now this really could go to 50. I’m not gonna get in though the theta is way too high now
30 eow
FOMO gotta be at all time highs right now. 😂
Guys please stay hydrated during the intense trading hours
🤜🏼🤛🏼

Highly doubt this is shorts covering definitely just retail fomo pushing it higher
Up until today they haven’t covered shit they only doubled down
- SEC, prohably
Those who missed out GME and wished they entered are those who talking shit about BBBY and definitely gonna wish they entered rn
Welp, I just got in with 50 BBBY shares @19.20 so, I hope the landing is nice

Should I buy more BBBY
Why is that even a question?

Never feel stupid for realizing gains
I realized to much of my gains :(

Once this passes AMC its going to explode!!!!!
Have the hedgies not learned? We will take everything they have
BBBY now we go to 30

This type of energy feels familiar. 🦍s hold the line. $BBBY 20 bucks by noon
I hope so. I just sold all the remaining stocks I had that were losses so no more hoping for that trash. Hopefully that money can go to some use now.
It’s a great time for bbby entries, but y’all won’t do it, scream “bagholders”, and then be pissy when it’s $30+ EOW.
OPEN THE BBBY YOU COWARDS!!!
hahaha BBBY bears, suck my DICK
Bobby is the one for me
DON'T TOUCH MY PURSE, I DON'T KNOW YOU
I just bought 10 BBBY shares on margin, LFG!!!
We’re watching GME Apes FOMO into BBBY in real time
and is that a problem?
BBBY calls GME puts today is free money. Who cares if it doesn't make sense.
there are mega whales in GME, they will re-enter back into GME once it levels off again for the next run
19 u fucking retards
Shorts are soooooo fukd
Anyone not buying BBBY must have buttons for eyes just like coralline

Don’t speak ill of her, you know you’d pipe the other mother.

Good dad.
No point having kids if you can't emotionally scar them (I don't want to be forgotten)
Wow there are so many angry ladyboys here hoping BBBY fails because they were too stupid to buy in before 10$

Bbby breaking $20 today
Sell your tesla sell your spy. We only have one stonk now.
BBBY 1
Why sell Tesla before the 17th when that’s the lockup date in order to have the 1+2 take place on the 24th?  If anything buy 34 TSLA and sell covered OTM weekly calls as safe income
Turned $400 into $9000 the last two weeks w BBBY calls and shares
I didn’t do options but I still doubled my money :)
You can either

\- Put it all in BBBY and retire in 2 weeks

\- Miss the boat and have to toil at your job another year until the next opportunity comes around

Your choice.
Bbby could go to 40 by Thursday, I’ve seen it before.
amc run last summer was like a 1.5-3 day affair, that was some wild shit
I made lottery money from 10 bucks
BBBY down 4.5% in premarket. 

If it was up 5%+ I'd do a megathread.
Should do a containment thread regardless

Buy the dip #bbby
Sick joke
BBBuuuuuY
BBBY, early morning dip if anybody was thinking about getting in. I’ll look into doubling down.
Waiting for Morning Market to see if it drops anymore, looking at the trend.
What is up with all these shills trying to pit BBBY traders against GME/AMC traders?
salty they missed all three ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
So its just sore buttholes? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)

Todays gonna be green
Lay off the spinach

That’s usually when it’s bigly green
Just like yesterday right?
bad news = going up. WMT is good earning today. The good news will go down.
I'm going to make a promise I never trade tesla again... what a fickle and obnoxious cunt of a stock. I buy calls it goes down I buy puts it rockets. Most unpredictable piece of over valued shite in this history of shite
I make that promise every time I had money
Sounds about right. Buy and hold is the only way to trade Tesla.
I hate it because at over 100 p/e I don't want to hold it at all it's massively over valued
Yup, but this irrational market doesn’t seem to care, interest rates aren’t keeping it down, QT isn’t keeping it down, not even Elon selling is keeping it down. Rally is tired, but keeps going up. Maybe it runs until the split, then it crashes 200 points in a month?
Spy with the premarket head fake. Going up 3% today.
It’ll drill hard enough to shake out calls and sell some more puts
Yeah its totally gonna do that bro
Bobby is the play, 22 by EOW 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉

They have a website like errybody else.
i have to take a shit
I got a gift card 2 Christmases ago. Spent it all within days and haven't been back.

But I'm also lazy and hate buying shit (besides options) so I'm not surprised.
Or an Amazon store

Just unloaded on bbby let’s keep this shit going
If I buy BBBY in the bath does it go up faster?
Look at this fancy bastard with a bath
I bought the bath helped by last time we did this. Unfortunately got less capital this time as literally turned GME in to a bed, a bath and beyond.
Buy…Buy….Buy…YOLO🚀🚀🚀🚀. No other chance!!
Yes, apparently
Bought 50 shares of BBBY.  So I'm sure it's about to tank now
It usually dips on Tuesdays
If it doesn’t then you don’t belong here
I consider myself a long term investor with my monthlies.
I've been investing in monthlies  for a long time.

Bears butthurt WMT beat.
The retailer's results surpassed analysts' expectations, but echoed its profit warning last month, when Walmart said inflation-pinched shoppers were buying less high-margin discretionary merchandise like apparel as they spent more on necessities. 

Walmart reiterated its forecast for the back half of the year. It expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to grow by about 3%, excluding fuel, for the second half of the year, or about 4% for the full year. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will decline between 9% and 11% for the full year.
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

Although today is a great day for moneymaking ideas and ways to boost your income, nevertheless, guard what you own and protect your possessions from loss, theft or damage. Meanwhile, keep your eyes open because you might find money! (But you might also lose money.) Oops!

Why is Spy dropping
>Imagine shorting a meme stock the day after volume pentupled

the failed test at 430 and can't hold 429 yesterday. today will go down.
Also crazy volume sometimes signals the end of a move and the top. Bbby breaks back up today or tmrrw or it’s done
easy short Bbby. Rip FOMO
idk man the volume today is still crazy at open
Not dropping

They need to stfu about the "tight labor market." It's like they only read headlines and never look at actual reports. 

The number of full time jobs DROPPED by 71k. Doesn't sound like companies are desparate for workers at all. And there's the fact that so many companies are able to force people back to the office.
Alot of companies are firing workers
Man these blocks of volume r insane on bbby

Did you make fake profit or not
I mean I want to place those calls for real, I’ve just done other options on paper for practice
Can't lose money on a paper account...can't make it either
Yeah that’s why I wanna try the 18 and 19$ calls for real this time, was just wondering if they’re idiotic and if I should go back to practicing lol

SPY $430c weeklies. This is going to be one of those slightly red mornings with the afternoon pump. Those earnings this morning are very healthy. No reason that the upward trend will stop.

It’s to do with liquidity normally

There are a number of factors but the one you’re likely facing is the high volume of trades going into whatever you want to invest in.

I’m holding my 19c until eow fuck it
With this much momentum 

A) nobody wants to sell, maybe a few people who reached some predetermined target that enables them to upgrade their lives but the vast majority will not sell when it’s going up this fast

 B) some will buy to ride the wave 

C) shorts will cover and 

D) market makers will have to deliver shares

I told them it will go to 80 before January, so that's covered
I sense a disturbance in the force. It's like thousands of watermelons cried out in pain.

BBBY Who sells it and can't get back on the ship makes a little money. Those who stay on the ship can catch a lot. Don't delay the ship!;)
So I shouldn’t sell for a profit so maybe you can make more money? Pass
>So I shouldn’t sell for a profit so maybe you can make more money? Pass

You need to know this. If you can sell it and buy it back cheaper, then maybe it's a good idea. I would hold it. But this is your decision.

I think 25 easy and maybe 30 by EOD now it’s holding above 20!!!
On a serious note does this make anyone else sad that, speaking as a millennial, these meme stocks have become my only realistic shot to ever have the means to buy a home.

You son of a bitch, I'm in.
Everyone in BBBY remember we may have a red day as some point, GME did. So don’t listen to the unhappy fucks that will be pushing to sell, because they want you to be like them. Diamond hands till the moon 💎🙌
Yes sir bot
Ignore anyone pushing anything other than BBBY, this is the play until EOW
EOY and Beyond
BBBY hauling ass
I you hwhat..
Are you ready! BBBY going to pump $19-$20 today short-selling interest is intensifying.
Something fun for BBBY. The stock can go 10x from here and the company has the same market cap as amc or Gme. Let that sink in if you’re on the fence about buying $BBBY
THIS
That
Is the way
AMC and GME are pretty shitty bar to set
Lol ok. Amc ran from 10 to 78 in less than a month. Gme went from 20 to over 400.
BBBBY down 3% in premarket 

Shills: “it’s over Bobby’s, pack it in.”
Sell everything! Do it now dont waste time!

My ridiculously low buy limits will thank you
Investors shrug off all forms of economic data and overbought indicators to continually cuck jpow and call his bluff on hiking rates

Lets say BBBY to 22$ is my hope for today. Downward pressure first thing but steady upward all day.

I hope it’s true, the downward shit show is to shake confidence of retail. Fuck shorts.
Closing my puts on open and joining the ride 30mins after the casino opens.

Is that not the same ownership? Thought he already had 9.5m in stock/options
He was 10% now hes 11.6% right?
In APRIL
Lets bust that $20 nut and head to $25. 

Squeeze. Hasnt. Started.
25$ would make me nut sooooo hard
600k volume in premarket and a lot of it was shares they borrowed at 55% interest ro short.

Bullish
Doesnt the fact that they are willing to pay 50% interest to short indicate that they find it extremely likely that it will fall? 

Or the fact that the cost to borrow for that high means that the borrowers charge a lot because they find it very unlikely that the share is gonna drop?

Or what is the dynamic here? Please explain
Apes are screaming BBBY $80 while worrying about every $0.10 movement

Pro-tip - never skip leg day.

Reason - picking a chick up from a sitting position with ease as it turns out really turns them on. In fact legs play a huge roll in running your lady to the bedroom.

Guys with buff legs fuck.
The ‘never skip leg day’ slogan convinced a lot of guys to pump their legs until they looked like ridiculous treetrunks while bicyclists and kickboxers have strong but lean legs that you can actually lift to kick and run and cycle ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Kicking is cool but have you ever given yourself a pink sock whilst squatting heavier than you should?

To infinity and BEYOND
Oh no BBBY down 66 cents! Doom! Blood bath!😭😭… literally stfu lmao just like GME, BBBY is still in the early stages
It’s ogre, clearly retail traders woke up at the ass crack of dawn and decided to sell when their app doesn’t even let them trade that early for premarket. Go home people, nothing to see here, you feeling sleepy I sure am? 😴🥱
The amount of negative bots in here is just confirming that BBBY will hit 20+ today
I did not personally play this position but I'm hoping for y'all big money big money big money
That’s some bs
Do you reckon they are paying Yahoo Finance to show the wrong price?
I hope bbby hits $1000.

That said, I’ve seen more bot like comments on the pro-bbby side.
Guarantee you everyone buying BBBY hasn’t actually set foot in a BBBY in the last year

Way more than a year. Closer to a decade.
I was there last week and bought the wife a possible pot. She loves being able to cook her boyfriend dinner
I never went into gamestop also yet I made a ton there.
This air fryer I'm cooking chicken tendies in says otherwise
They closed down the one that was by me.  Even more reasons to be bullish.
I'm buying the dip in the bathrobe I bought from there a couple months ago.
My mom bought something from bbby this weekend which is why I jumped in again
I got a tervis there for like $11 a few years ago. Their sales aren't bad.
I feel BBBY is going to $40 very soon.
BBBY keep BBBuYing
BBBY normal chart !! No crash 💥
looks like im gonna get a discount on BBBY at open today
BBBY gonna blow past AMC next week, possibly by friday
AMC refuses to get out of its own way and tank. Needs to go ahead and have one of them falling off a cliff days like it wanted to yesterday. I wrote calls I'd like to collect the full premium on.
Cramer called and said sell Bobby, you know what that means🚀🚀🚀
I’m loaded up on shares and calls 🚀
Too much is not enough

If BBBY should call on you ...
Is there any reason why there is always a pump in futures at 7 AM?
MF’ers be wakin up yo.
That’s when premarket opens
And they always choose buy instead of sell. Okay got it
Where have you been all summer and may
Tsla to the moon 🚀
BBBY is GME in its beginnings
How did HOOD slip to $11? Two figures is way to much
It's a bull market. Every shitty company is pumping. Though won't last long.
Man it was cringe hovering 10...11 is crazy pump summer fest
I deposited 1000 into rh and my balance is -30. I didn’t buy anything

Great broker ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Called a broker because that's what it makes you.
Right! They’ve been “reviewing” my account for like 2 months , still locked down….

Made my day
Apple is red and bbby is green. That means BBBY is the better company
how far is BBBY away from its ATH vs. apple?
That doesn't mean shit. If anything, that means u should sell ur apple for bbby. Also, i was clearly being sarcastic. Way to take the joke seriously
lol someone is defensive
She is a fucking squirter!
You know that’s pee right!?
Stonks for the win. One time for the Apes BBBY
Go Bobby go!! 100sh for me at open
You know things are going well when every price drop bears post gay shit in the comments like “oh check the volume, bbby is over”

Damn we’re gonna blast through 20 aren’t we
there’s a lot of people selling at $20 which is annoying but once we get to like $20.50 i think it’ll rocket off again
When V shape recovery? 

Apple laying off people? BULLISH

Walmart met expectations after downgrading? BULLISH?

Cancelling Billions of orders? VERY BULLISH

Less houses built? Supply and demand baby! Prices go up = BULLISH

Walmart met and saved that day. People of Walmart we salute you
What year are we in?  2022 or 2023

Walmart Inc. said on Tuesday its revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2023 increased by 8.4% to $152.9 billion and surpassed market expectations, adding that the company maintained its outlook for the remainder of the year. Operating income remained mostly unchanged at $6.9 billion.o
A lot of companies report earnings based on the year they release the report. So they're in Q2 of their 2023 reporting year, since they'll release their next annual report in the calendar year 2023.
Gotcha.

There's a separate BBBY megathread. Why don't you get on it.
There's an r/stocks subreddit. Why don't you get on that?
Could someone explain how this bbby thing is gonna screw over wallstreet. I’m new to this on just bought 5 shares
It's not screwing wallstreet you're literally just betting against a hedge fund and taking their money.
You need more than 5 shares to screw wallstreet
He’s not going to screw Wall Street by himself that’s the whole point of this little movement lol
They have shares shorted which means for every dollar bbby goes up they owe a dollar to the person they borrowed the share from. So if price goes up they get screwed. That’s the general idea
Hedge funds thought they could beat the market into submission by shorting over 100% of bbby shares. WSB stood up to this irresponsible shorting and is boosting the price of the stock back up so that the Citadel has to buy back at a higher price than they sold for, thus screwing them over. The more we buy and the longer we hold, the more they get screwed over at least theoretically.
It won’t we’re just trying to make some money

strike price is 12.50 then just do it now wtf

the profit is negligible compared to the risk on a call like that when you're that far into the money
Guys, I tried my best. But I am a 🌈 🐻 at heart. I was born this way. added 10 400p dec22

Let’s get this gamma on bbby on Thursday boyz
Hello $19?
bbby is my only thing that is green today.
Good thing i didnt listen to the guy who told me to sleep on my idea of buying calls
Elon is definitely selling again
mods need to start banning ppl who make bets but dont execute them when the stock price target hits
If BBBY breaks 20, 30 is not a meme
It hit 20!
19!!! HODL
MELON TIME 🤣🤣🤣
Its a bad day to be a watermelon boys
69 eow is not a meme ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
EVERYBODY STAY CALM!
Hello BOBBY $19
Get the Watermelons ready!!!!!!
kinda regretting exiting bbby this morning.  I profited but I can't afford to have the rug pulled on me right now.  Best of luck BBBY to the moon!
Bbby at 40 is not a meme
B-B-B-BUY!!!!!! SHORTS HAVEN'T EVEN COVERED YET!!!! $400 NEXT!!
If you think this bbby squeeze is stupid, you’re the stupid one. Open ur mind and look at the setup. The SI, the options, it was all there. Autism is the way.
Fuck there went 20
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Calls on watermelon sales
Push push past $20, head to $30
Time for a watermelon to get fucked!!
BANBET 20 1d smashed

Lmao mainstream media SILENT about BBBY
# ELMO FIRE MEME 🔥🔥
MOTHER OF GOD.

Keeping buying shares, guys
Of course who wouldn’t buy shares at these prices when a 10% BBBY share holder is betting it will be $80 in Jan.  Duhh.  😀
Damn halts are coming soon
This thing breaks $20 and it's circuit breaker time
Glad I didn't take that banbet for 20
BUY BUY
Getting text messages about this from random old friends.  It’s happening again lol 😆
IT BROKE 20 HOLY SHIT
Lol from 19.84 to 20.45 in one trade

Glad I cancelled my $20 sell orders
This is fucking insane
Holy fuck! Damn! Wish I had hopped on the ride with you all.
Not to late
Let the watermelon fucking commence!
LMAO chart is just a straight line up
Watermelon fucking time!
This is fucking amazing
What the fuck $bbby
Its the fvcking shit
The fact I was seriously considering getting into BBBY at 9 stings, but with current price 16 entry still nice. Lol @ my dumbass thinking 13 was too high to fomo then doing it anyways at 16.
we in this 🚀🚀🚀
Nasdaq down -0.69%

Bears: nice!
Why is price for bbby on fidelity behind???

HOLD OR BUY MORE

&#x200B;

DO NOT SELL
Discount price
Jesus, congrats to holders, paper handed half at 100% and another half of that at 200%.  Only a small bit left, I'll sell half of that at 300%.  Feels like infinite money glitch.
RIP watermelons
Market legit goes up every single day for weeks and weeks until I finally get and hold calls…wow
Yup simulation is rigged lol
we get to see a guy fucking melon kunis and another guy eat a whole fucking watermelon, perhaps the same one

You know I’m buying this dip, it’s a veritable squeez bobby!
WSB is in a new dfucking level. Holy.

RECHARGE THE ROCKETS
Is this the squeeze 💁🏼‍♂️
$420 sell wall?
IV going to rocket even more in 3...2.....
GME 2.0, the path is before you, now take what is rightfully yours
I sell automatically by 19,66€ 😓 but I enter again all in bbby
your not alone![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
First time I ever got into a trade so early! Loaded the boat at 4.78 but only 5k worth. Should have gone full port
Same, but that’s easy to say now. Have fun with your 1000+ shares.
Yeah you’re right! Same to you!
Did the circuit breakers start? No? Then the shorts havent covered.
Good everything going according to plan. Don’t sell yourselves out boys, this is small potatoes
Just bought another 100
Die Apple you overbought piece of shit!
It just keeps fucking going!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
last bear trap of the week :)
Do people actually believe that everyone who calls out moronic ponzi’s are net short? I have no position in BBBY. The WSB daily is for attacking stupid things and supporting smart things. We would attack any retarded investment it’s a forum
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Theres data. Its been the top shorted stock a few times.
How is free money regarded?
50$ GOOOAAALLLL
…Yeah you shouldn’t have sold this dip either
Let’s consolidate here for a bit then snatch 22 bbby
I'm going to go jerk off to calm down a little, when I come back I want to see over $20. Lesssgo BBBY
If the SPY could quit fucking around until I get rid of this last call that would be fantastic.
TSLA acquires the boring company and starts drilling operations in the stock market.
Hey kiddo, is this one of em, whatcha call it, red day? We used to have those a lot back in my day, chief
SPY will go up in about 22 minutes and will not stop.
🦍 🦧 🙊 🚀🚀🚀
🌽🌽 loosing critical support 

📉📉📉
I will only be satisfied if we touch 34 today. If not dont even bother talking about it.
Ken just discovered that you can use soap dispensers for mayo that’s why BBBYs price is going up.
Can anyone explain why SPY fell off a cliff
bulls not enough greedy.
Wen 20?
WEN is 21
Noweeee
I can’t believe TSLA cucked me again. Fuck
Same bro, even on my 925 buy
Some people just never learn.
FUCK YES BOYS
SPY bottom at 426.5 roughly then we resume uptrend
10 more percent on the day let’s go !!!
Money flowing out of Apple and into The towel store
Too much cum
Gonna need to clean up the mess about to be created
RELOAD!!!
I feel like it's bullish that it's consolidated here for a few minutes, but I'm kinda dumb ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
tbh we should be happy if it closed at this price, insane were here after 1 fucking hr
Fomo!
When do the billboards go up
Probably around $40 or so
 Tesla calls here tho 😮‍💨
Can retail buy quicker than insiders can sell?
Hold the line guys we have to hold here
My SQQQ calls bought yesterday are still down. Guess the strike was dumb.
Duh
I guess stop limits are not completely useless after all

We've eroded and broken through the sell walls at 17,18,19 & 20, once we get past 20 and stay there there's a lot less resistance to slow it down.

So glad I jumped in at $15 and $16.27
BBBY pajama party tonight??
COME ON !!!
Remember when BBBY was down 66 cents in PM and bears were saying “lol how are bulls calls!!” Lmaoooo what colors your Bughetti?
might have to roll out these BBBY calls…the 19th isn’t enough for me anymore
Do we know who is getting squeezed?
Unironically lots of retail shorts too, look at all the people who buy puts on memes when they pump. Puts on memes almost never work
Volume is 🍌🍌🍌🍌
BBBY is the inverse of the entire market today 🚀🚀🍆
Lol I had the order for 500 shares @ $16.30 on the preview trade screen when the market opened and didn’t go through with it. I’m the real regard here
It’s never too late
I hope some of you that actually need the cash know when to take profits of BBBY. That time is now.
Lmaooo aapl imagine thinking it would go down ever
Ok so we already broke the $20 EOW goal, keep pushing til it hits $50 EOW? 🚀

C'mon BBBY save my marriage. The gamble on pinterest at $17 a share paid off
Some serious copium going off in the AMC subreddit, almost the worst I’ve ever seen. One guy  says “just hold and get the fuck off reddit, this place is becoming infuriating lately”

Something something cognitive dissonance.

We touching 100% today. I fucking called it.
Looking at 300 mil volume today!
Holy shit it's actually happening
BBBY is peaking so much Im scared of wether to hold till tomorrow or take all my gains today
This goes mainstream today and keeps pumping through eow for sure
I’m actually not sure what to do either lol
Hodl pussy
I sold half, but I’m holding rest for inevitable gamma on Thursday
My calls expire Friday so I’ll probably hold till tomorrow then
Sell and buy some 45c lottos for Friday. They are cheap
This is actually beautiful
BBBY absolutely disconnected from GME & AMC today, which means? ...
Every dip getting swallowed up
So satisfying that my little mini fomo limit buy immediately filled at 21 despite never even seeing the line go down to that price.
Slow and steady bbby, do me slow and steady

I hope it’s not white power related

Shorts crashed the price 50 cents in about 30k shares traded. I'm sure that'll hold considering yesterday we had 160 million in volume...
You’re assuming the 160m will happen again today
It wont, but I bet 50-80 million will happen so I wonder how the artificial drop on 30k shares will hold up.
Todays volume will be higher then yesterdays with the news coverage and word of mouth

Irrational market strikes again.  Yeah WMT beat absolute shit expectations, but it still performed like shit, guidance is still shit, just slightly less shit.  Like putting cheese on your shit sandwich.  Still a shit sandwich.
This market is for the children of summer. the fall QT doubling will show them no mercy

-	t. Bear on concentrated copium
QT will never happen because it can't happen.
My WMT puts are going to get destroyed at open now. I’m about to just go full calls on everything at this point might as well make money on the irrational nonsense while it lasts
Algorithms buying atm, nothing to see here. Takes some humans to start selling
Apes went from a used video game store to a bed sheet store, they sure know how to pick em.
At least they’re not *used* bedsheets.
*yet*
Used bed sheets would sell like hot cakes if u know the bathwater market. Just imagine if ur bed sheeets has female squirt
You need to look at mcaps, gme and amc weren’t played out till they went well above 10b, bbby isn’t even 2b yet.
In our defense, one of those skyrocketed to 400 and the other is incredibly promising, sooo yea. I guess we do know how to pickem. Thank you ;)
I’m in BBBY but we need a separate thread. I know how much I hate it when the GME people flood the daily and I know it’s annoying lol.
More shorts piled in for bbby, equals more
Money for longs. Buy buy buy baby hell yea. And higher ctb. Let’s get that sexy sexy

If BBBY is such a buy and to the moon, why does a weekly breakeven call at $16 cost $600 and a $16 put cost $3k?  Legit question as you stand to make more off the call than put. Yes, Im a crayon eater.
IV
Its basicly a gamblle at this point it can moon it can crash we dont know.
Agreed, as the whole market is a casino, but it seems as though calls are promoted and you stand to lose way more on a put.
Well at this point most memestocks are the ones leading the market there is still some good bluechips that has no started their pump so their is still some good gains to be made
We don't need blue-chip, just the next HKD ;). Guess I'll just hang on to remaining bbby to see what happens and forego options on it for now. No balls, I know.
What are you on? The call Is 2.35 and the put is 2.42. Back to school for you

And the others responding to you are just as retarded ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Robinhood for options. Schwab for stocks. Pot for relaxation. Beer for sleep. Crayons for nutrients. 

Was just looking at the options pricing at a $16 breakeven price after a 23% up day and expected cheaper puts.
Why?
Because I believe this sub is mostly bots now and I dont believe the hype with all this flooded bbby shit.
Oh we're on the same team then
Options are priced in now you had to buy them two weeks ago
Jim Cramer gots a huge hard on for bbby. PERVERT!

Bears celebrate a -0.7% day after +30% rally ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

More like - 0.1%![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
BBBY strong 💪
Here we go 🚀
Yes you beautiful apes… its happening
This is going to be $60 EOW easily
Everyone in this sub will have to testify before congress
Suck our collective dick
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Just day traded my BBBY options, sold for $500 gain in 5 minutes!  Going to rebuy at $16
16? LOL we may never hit that again
We just dropped 6% in about 1 min,  you sure about that?
16 is long gone
When's that going to be?
We have had 1 red day in the last 15 says of trade.  We are due for one soon
Spy going down hell yeah
I am usually a bull, but I have been dabbling with puts and they have been printing on several positions.
man people really buying and selling at 16.90 and 17.30's? That such a waste of time and money hahahaha
HE IS STILL HOLDING (Ryan)
I can taste the short fear with this one. It's almost like the ghost of GME is haunting these fucks. Every short hedgie wants to pile on a loser, but nobody wants to pay 50% CTB if this becomes a CULT and takes a year to bleed off 😂
Make way for BBBY, destroyer of shorts.
I just bought 31 shares. It’s not much but it’s honest work. First timer here. It’s an honor to be here
The battle for $18 is raging
if we hit 18 in under an hour I might nut
COME ON 18
Come on 18 you beautiful mf
It's a-comin'!

Better off selling meth in Portland 

Better ROI
meth bad. portland bad.
Yes
I love Austin because I live in Austin.  Where u be?
I currently live in portland oregon, I just think Austin is a great place to make money with a vacation home.
yesh represent represent atx
step 1:make money with bbby
step 2:put it all on TSLA puts
step 3:post your loss porn for karma
House prices in Austin are Southern California level
is that good or bad? i thought atx had some low housing costs
Bad. Median sale price for a shithole is $630k
GUYS THIS CAN GO TO 30$ TODAY IF WE HOLD
I lost 40k today by selling BBBY at what I thought was the top to rebuy lower....I feel bad man
Lol loser
Just hit a 1k options lick. This shits going to $27
Im not even flinching
I went 99% in when extended hours started, then did a pissy little day trade so I didn't have any left, I'm locked in
"Honey!  Looks like we're gettin a new bidet and an inflatable hottub for the trailer." I yelled across the trailer while scarfing down my Salisbury steak TV dinner and looking at the BBBY price.
BBBY 30 EOW
EOD
EOH
Everybody buy 10 shares for the cause!
Did it for the crew
Ryan Cohen stonks

Good lord I’m hard

Get out of here with that reasonable take!
>I’m playing it cool

You're a retard. How are you going to make back that $160k if you don't yolo?
[deleted]
160k on a penny stock, LMAOOMG
And with that break over 23, my last batch of 20c just sold for 500% gain. I will buy your dip if you dip for me, bbby, I love you forever 🥰
Good god, how did we screw it up so bad? We gave every child in the world a handheld supercomputer with access to all of the world's knowledge and the answers to every conceivable question at their fingertips. 

They should all be becoming geniuses, at never-before-seen speeds.

=== ====

But no, they just watch slutty TikTok videos all day long, and iMessage their dumb friends.
Genuises are born, not made with smartphones
People still believe their education makes them smart, some are retiring now a lifetime of experience kicking them in the head proving how dumb they are but they still look back to their college years believing they did it they succeeded they had something special that no others had a degree in gender studies
Ridiculous amounts of "knowledge" are impractical in a world where are the answers are available on our phones.

Intelligence has revealed itself to be more than knowledge these days.
Yes and buy far otm calls that 10x
Where my 🦍 s @????

How much is a chamber?
Asking the real questions
BBBY has gotten to 16 once and it can do it again
Naaa it’s skipping 16 this time lol
BBBY holders confused because their favorite towel and curtain rod retailer isn't up 6% in pre-market.
I am all in $bbby and this my first time trading with you guys .. Lets f*ng be rich 🚀🪐
⚡️🚀⚡️
\*gambling
BBBY regards, you’re surely fully sized by now. We’ve had weeks now. who’s still buying ?

[removed]
I THINK. WE AINT FUCKIN DONE. 50 eow🦇🦇🦇
Alright I caved, bought 1,000 shares at $19.94

I will single-handedly implode BBBY
Better for BBBY if the posts to stay here tbh.
Bbby going to run
BBBY is leaving the station in 90 min.
Bbby, you need to get your ass back up to $17 now
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
#You can literally see the moments when the GMEtards are selling for BBBY if you compare their charts LMFAO
I've been burned before on a pump and dump, surely it wont happen again?
If (When) $BBBY hits $20 today I’m going to college debt free.
Uncle Joe is waiting for it to hit 20 to announce the cancellation? He's gotta pay for it somehow

They already borrowed almost 92k shares at 55% just in premarket. Only 8k shares left to borrow.

55% is the highest CTB yet

!banbet BBBY 20 3d
**Ban Bet Created:** **/u/UUSWE** bet **BBBY** goes from **15.21** to **20.0** before **2022-08-19 06:18:39.375383-04:00**
What's our reward if we win a ban bet? Nothing?
It shows how many you’ve won and lost

I lost like three times more than what I won so nobody respects me
You have to keep using WSB. It’s really more of a punishment than a reward.
"Where's this green coming from?", "Why is every red candle getting bought up?"  


Probably the fact that every decent fund manager is being told to aggressively buy any dip available in the broader market before we get pumped back to all-time-highs by the end of Q3
Alot of funds was holding cash last few month, and when the market rally hedgies also FOMO each others cuase the last guy holding cash is always gonna be the bag holder
I can never tell sarcasm from stupidity on this site.

Who would be the person telling them? And how would buying the dip work when most every large fund passively tracks an index?
-Institutions ended Q2 with record-high cash balances

-Blackrock, JPM, Bridgewater (all three have very large AUM relative to other institutions) have publicly gotten bullish on equities with JPM in particular calling for 4800 S&P by EPY - there is no ulterior motive here. Shilling stocks is something they wouldn’t do if they were waiting for stocks to continue lower. You get in before the public, not after.

-Many smaller funds like Tom Lee’s FundStrat (which called for a “treacherous first half of the year in which stocks could end negative — spoiler alert - they did) are now publicly advising dip buying in the broader markets and are putting cash to work themselves.

-Whether a fund tracks an index is literally unrelated. We aren’t talking about *what* you’re buying, we’re talking about the release of record high sidelined-cash.

Tl;dr: Your comment is as stupid as it is ironic. “HURRR HOW CAN INSTITUTIONS BUY THE DIP” get this fool out of here. How the fuck do you think markets move? You think *we’re* doing it???
Da boss man
Wtf is this a BBBY thread?
It’s the only stock that matters
Yes
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Sir, this is a casino thread
"BBBY dead" "Bagholders" when it was down $0.80 this morning lmaooo.  So many salty dudes who are missing out, choosing to sit on the sidelines or even short the next best play for a while.  


You guys really do belong here.
People shit talking bbby are the same ones that think they got a big dick cuz they to manage to make 400 bucks off spy calls 2 twice a month
$800/m isn’t bad tbh
That’s a studio in the suburbs
Financial advice.

Buy 45 day puts if everyone on wsb sounds redartedly bullish

Wrong way BBBY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)

BUY BUY BBBY
#BBBY WILL GO RIGHT PAST AMC ON ITS WAY TO $40
Lol I wonder if they will all jump on bbby
2 completely different market caps yet you're comparing share price 🤡
Massive pump or dump on BBBY within 13 minutes
Pump*
Sold half my shares 17.5 looking to rebuy a dip
Oops
No oops. Very good reason to sell around 18, which is where I dropped the second half
If it holds a 4H candle above 17.50 I think it will gap up to around 19 so under that condition I can jump in again as well
Fair enough :) I’m terrible at timing that shit and it usually burns me and I FOMO back in higher
Damnit lol. I did buy back a 100 shares at 17.25 at least
This is highly unusual activity for any ticker in WSB. I won’t even try to play it. The amount of attention is insane. Even Cramer is tweeting as if to get back in WSB good graces by talking it up lol
BBBY $20 🚀🚀🚀
Bobby flying
Blast OFF!!!!  BBBY to the moon jump aboard
We're closing at 20 today
Dump your portfolios and put it all in BBBY **NOW!!!!!**
Not fooking selling all the way to $100
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
please reply if you are actually buying rn
yup - no brainer
I sold off last week out of fear. But I believe this has at least $25-40 in it, if not $100-300.
🧻🧻
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Can we hit $80 for my birthday this week?

Imagine all the peo-ple
With schools starting again, watch out for school zone speed limits. Also, don’t trade and drive.

Bobby the retard power is on
This whole rally started when oil prices started dumping in mid June, it's the only indicator you needed. Ever since then, even bad news became super good news
Nobody realizes the impact a shipping container going from 5000 to 25000 has on profits . We house electronics in my warehouse for my customer. Sometimes they can only fit 300 on a container which means they are paying an extra $66 per unit to ship here . When they sell for $500 that kills the small business
It doesn't matter if shipping companies locked in long contracts at elevated prices. That dip in shipping won't matter
Cue meme of ape looking at a butterfly and calling it hedge fund fuckery
Your portfolio deserved better.
Sorry about your loss
I'm gonna need tesla yo fade about 6 percent today.
$1,000 EOD guaranteed now - thanks.

Baka! We are just friends!
Based purely on two visits to target with my girlfriend, I think target is fukt. It's been almost empty, clothes literally on the floor, big clearance section. While Walmart is so crowded it takes 20 minutes to checkout even in the self checkout line.
Well my gf and i spent $120 there yesterday so wejust saved it
White girls have a stranglehold on target, they all use the drive up pick up now, my target has tow rows of parking spaces completely dedicated to it.
My target just enlarged their drive up section and busted a new door through the wall so the workers can get to the cars quicker.
“Dang it BoBBY, what have I told you about putting Peter Pan peanut butter on your balls and havin’ ol’ Ladybird here lick it off?”
Pro-p-haaaane
Shorts just got reloaded with 350k shares available to borrow. They will short it like crazy today. Mostly likely a red day. 

That's not going to stop the Thursday/Friday moon mission though. 

Lambo or bankruptcy 
https://imgur.com/a/fViEUY2
You can see the move in the chart at 08:00 in the Time & Sales tape, I had always wondered what those big ticks in premarket were. You would think in the absence of liquidity in PM such a trade would move the price a lot.

Exactly those 350k shares got traded in a manner that didn't move the price much, so price stays high in order to improve the entry point for shorts.
2yr account
?
So this lame ass market is still gonna keep going green huh

This shit hits 440 this week and I’m sinking everything into December puts. Won’t even be mad if i lose on it
Bestbuy has the best sheets
I buy all my video games and Funko pops at best buy.
Bobby is boycotting AMC because their CEO is a lazy cum dumpster
My bbby average is just over $15 hoping for a juicy dip today
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Wow you are shitting on ppl for 25 minutes now congrats ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Sorry for your losses
Dont be sorry for me,  be sorry for your time
Nah I'm sorry for your losses.
Last week market was weak on tuesday because of cpi the next day, if you think bbby’s chart is going to look like last week’s, and that you have time to swing it and average in, you’re going to get btfo by the pump.
Bear and bulls are like Republicans and Democrats. Play both sides reeeee's
SPY moving $0.19 is still more impressive than any memestock rally
These hedgies truly underestimate the common retard. Support is too strong
Bbby will end this week at $6 or $20+, no in between lol
20+
Another melt up at open?
Bers gonna end the day very sad today
My $139 $WMT calls finna print bigly
Cramers looks rattled. Walmart faking pumping.
My girl likes slapping my ass ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
alpha women are hot
My girl loves shoving her finger up my ass
Just returning the favor when I come over and slap her ass
I hate when she does that.
Who here enjoys losing money?
I don't, but I still do it anyways just to fit in here...
I do, which is why I'll probably end up being a BBBY bag holder :(
$BBBY blowing up today. Buying more in 3 minutes. 20 bucks by noon then BBBY. LFG!!!!
I hope everyone has a great day today!
Buy

#BBBY TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!
Pod now racing is this
It was fun while it lasted. See you guys in an hour when it’s at $20.
Don’t sell BBBY, it always starts with a morning sell off then comes back
Do not sell your bbby. Learn from the others who sold Friday and yesterday. Either they going to miss the whole play now or buy in at a way higher price just for some small gainz.
Diamond hands!

Once B Boy breaks $18, next stop is $20
Then $21
Then $69
Hold a 4H above 17.50 and it gaps to 19 imo
In case you’re new here… they will 100% tank the indices to kill momentum and stop the storm from a-brewing
True.
Just did some TA and BBBY is going up
Mod intelligence
fighting for a flair daily
Only 846,000 shares left on the sell side up to 30$
If this were a Bear Market Rally then the S&P 500 gain of +17.19% off the decline of -23.55% would be the GREATEST bear market rally ever after an interim bear market decline of -27.77% or less. Also fuck BBBY
$BBBY 18 🚀🚀

They borrowed 100k shares at 55% this morning to suppress the price.....checks notes.....59 cents
That’s not quite how it works but yeah; it’s a good sign of 🚀
I got perma banned from r/investing for some reason. All I did was give them great advice on BBBY
God gave you this one opportunity to send you BBBY, for he so loved the world. God is great. And so too is BBBY
God damn, it’s hard to tell girls age’s these days…. 15 year old be looking like 25 year olds while 25 year olds be looking like 15 year olds!!! How tf am I supposed to know before I hit on them?!?!?!
Ask about their age?
You say hey are you in school or just ask age, not that serious
Seems weird… 

“Hey, I know we just met, but how old are you?
No you approach and then when you’re about to go for the number then you say by the way how old are you
Just go for the grannies to be safe
# Maybe yu shud ax dem firzt
That just comes off weird….

“Hey, thought you were hot…. How old are you?”
Ask where they were on 9/11
Ask them if they ever had aspirations to be “TikTok famous”
No time for such trivial questions my boy
Go for dudes instead, dummy
BBBY is easy, have the shorts covered?

No..... We hold.
Soldiers!! The battle for BBBY is just getting started. 

Load up and hold the line!
Congrats on your 3rd ever comment on Reddit! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

But in all seriousness YES

It has been done
Foolish
Ya do it
Bro just play anything else, look at the market it’s insane rn, BBBY isn’t a sure thing

The only thing this BBBY squeeze is missing is a champion. Who will rise up and be DFV 2.0?
DEEP
**So i thought shorting $BBBY was a good idea, man was i wrong, LETS GO UP MOARE!!!**
Goofy shit right there
Today is the day BBBY skyrockets 🚀
Even if not today I’ll take a solid 20 percent day before liftoff
We’re just going to pump 1% at open right ?
	you bet your ass
More like after 12 and end green by close
AAPL yes, finally capitulate you bloated bitch
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
$BBBY gang: green or red at open?
Yes
red then green
Papa RC added more lol
Just read an analyst downgrade BBBY saying sell it now ots valuation is way to high and unrealistic...

That analyst must have just woke up from a coma. How can your job be to analyze stocks and you completely ignore a central driving source like wsb... like wtf.

Fired lol.
I wish mods would make a separate thread for BBBY, daily thread is spammed now
All the bbby spam is brutal
Cohen bought more
No he didn't. His position is literally exactly the same. Stop spreading misinformation
That 6.2m share buy was me btw. Yall r welcome
BBBY is going to break the market

Fomo is at peak, top is in boys
Are we preparing for a long squeeze?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
It's ganna bounce again I am sure there were lots of sell orders in at 20.
if BBBY goes to $50 before close, Ill eat my nut.

Alone, with no one watching.

Hell with him
Being on WSB and hating on BBBY is like being fan of a sports team and telling other fans ‘yeah we won the championship in 2021 but obviously we won’t be able to do it again regard’
No it’s nothing like that
How do you trust a woman that says she’s on the pill? You’re putting your life in her hands when you cum inside her
You’re putting your life in her pussy
you’re not putting life in her HANDS…
give her fake name and address just in case.
Keep a coat hanger close by
Watch her take the pill every day
Do I ask her to FaceTime me every day she does that?
because you call it that i know youre not ready
Because I call it what?
puts on your hands
Ask her to see the pills they have like day names on them and stuff you can 100% tell if they are honest

Paperhands on BBBY because of a hedge fund downgrade ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) everyone keeps downgrading it but then it keeps going up.
I feel like that just makes it look better at this point
If we close over 20 I will fuck some nacho cheese and post it.

Yss, towels as currency?
Towels and hands soap 🧼
Bed sheets can be used as 100$ bills, towel - 10$bills, hand soap- 1$ and scented candles - 50$ 

What could go wrong
Amazing
Would be worth more than the FIAT bs we have in circulation today. Takes more time to make a towel than it does to print a dollar.
Well a towel is around 20$ so there is that. The dollar is just a piece of toilet paper at this point

I can’t wait for market open so I can buy discounted BBBY before it takes off

The crazy part is ORTEX thinks the BBBY shorts actually increased from Friday close to Monday close.

[Friday close - Live SI% 48.42%](https://imgur.com/oHM72RO)

[Monday close - Live SI% 50.67%](https://imgur.com/tSklqV3)

Also GME sits at [20.54% SI%](https://imgur.com/a9oyqXj) so the GMEtards need to shut up and understand their time came and went.
Just like every other day, calls at open!
Calls at 10am maybe, if it is like Gamestop they usually dump it for the first 30 minutes and it works back for the rest of the day.
Early pre-market BBBY -5% was a sign of SHF desperation.
I mean what retail trader even makes trades that early? Obviously not any of us

How is there more buys than sells and yet drilling this hard?
that's not how markets work. there're always an equal number of buys and sells (ie, you can't buy if no one will sell, and you can't sell if no one will buy). it's all about the structure of the order.

Hopefully we don't have a mass selloff at $20
Not with this much momentum
There is nothing to hold B Boy back after $20
I don’t see why we would it we held at 10 and 15. I think getting to 20 just shows how much exponentially higher we could actually go
if it pushes past 20 quick, i doubt people will sell but if it meets any sort of resistance there, people will definitely take their gains and dip

Not feeling very confident in my Walmart calls, I guess my thought process and q3 guidance will be good
I ordered a vacuum from Walmart about a month ago so I’m doing my part to help out your calls.
How does it work?
Pretty good, it’s a handheld shark vac. Got it mainly to clean up the car regularly. No complaints so far.
Doubling down
It sucks.
Guidance will lower, I guarantee it
You could’ve given me your insider info yesterday
That’s illegal, sorry ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
Walmart predictions?
I mean they guided lower and on top of that they are higher now than when they announced layoffs and lower guidance so I don't see how they don't drop. If not its a scam
I’m scared for my calls![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)

Or we can do this the haaard way

What’s it gonna be?

Imagine panic-selling gme early in the second week it got some momentum because of a lil volatility, when it looked just like this. Just wait and sell on the down-swing lmao, better 1/3 of a 200+ peak than 16.

Do we think TSLA split will be sell the news???  Just trying to figure out when I should get back in since there are several resistance levels here.  I mean it would have to break above them hard for it to run higher right now.  Any thoughts?

90% of those probably came from me. Been seething from 410 upwards
whoever is keeping SPY down show yourself

Excited for $PENN with casinos totally reopened and football starting
I’m new to this.  At what cost per share amount will Puts start to really panic?  Are we nearing that point?
Basicly they have alrd started to panic, they just kept doubling down thats why we have this rally its a bear liquidation rally
How is Dow CHAD Nones flying like this ?
Goddammit I sold FUBO for profit but it’s 🚀 now
I didn't realize FUBO was a publicly traded company. lol  


I don't hate their platform, but it feels very distant compared to YouTube TV in regards to quality streams and setup. I wish FUBO's packages were on par with others over being a confusing setup of how they seem to randomly put channels into one color or the other.

Market falling guys look don’t be retards
Damn congrats to TSLA put holders.  Sold my calls at the top.  I knew I should’ve switched to puts.  🤬🤬
To be fair it's an absolutely minor dip. Anything between -5% and +5% daily change is just routine for TSLA.
Could be limit sells at $18 tho
All BObbytards pls move to megathread

Why are we drilling?  Makes no sense because inflation peaked and the FED pivoted.  My fucking calls are getting destroyed
Because bbby. If I remember correctly when Gme was running the rest of the market was shit as well.
It's been a straight line up for a month at this point, what did you think would happen
Because there’s no reason for red. All the news has been bullish
Even if we had just great news after great news (which is not really the case), market is going to have some red days.  Can't been green every day.  QQQ was up 20%+ at EOD yesterday from the lows a month+ ago.
>Makes no sense because inflation peaked and the FED pivoted.

How they gonna fuck us this time?

It's Happening!!!!!
Which bbby strike and expiration should I buy for a decent and realistic 10 bagger ?
Go back in time to 7/29 and get 10c for $10
Rewind three weeks and pick almost anyone you want lol
Best shots for a 10 bagger are 30 expiring Friday or 26 expiring next Friday. Both risky though
Any strike at any expiration
“Hey bro I just bought calls today why we dumping” lol 😂
You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain
I think the government should subsidize uber that way people dont have to buy cars to get around, and my uber stock would go up.

Hopefully today or my calls are fuct
It’s good to slow down. Look at GME and AMC. This is following similar trends. Could dump at $30. Could dump at $60. Past that? Probably won’t dump until $300.
I trust SUE!!!
WE MUST KEEP THE BUYING PRESSURE GOING
QQQ: shambo, BBBY: lambo
1 min of silence for each paperhand who sold under 20$
Followed immediately by a minute of hearing us go *wooooooooohooooo.*
Nah they don’t deserve it
That IV on BBBY options is getting wild, I’m gonna be kicking myself for a while for passing up on buying those $15 calls I was eyeing last week
I had to quit thinking about it. They were $19 when I was hovering over the Buy.
Yea, calls are up +230% lmao. I wish I bought some too, but it's too expensive now
You're not already kicking yourself?
Nah that much yet, but if this really does go to 30 or 50 like I’m starting to think it will then I’ll get some real self loathing haha. At least I have IONQ calls to soften the blow

/u/ArtourTheBabyrage (1W/7L) made a bet that BBBY would go to 20.69 when it was 19.79 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
Get in the $APRN train early!! its only trading at $5.5
Early? It's 22% up today lol
Bbby is trading at $22 y got in at $5
So yeah its early

Lol do I add more? Oh man.
More melons to fuck is a good thing
Fuck u pussys not holding bbby or for buying options
Stop saying nonsense like that. Retail makes up 5% of what's going on with BBBY
Kind of sad how short the attention span is for BBBY. It’s still the play. Pre market means zero. It will have a huge drop at open. That’s a discount. Buy and hold.
They're literally insolvent. This is not a "buy and hold" play lol
It is for the next week
$BBBY TO 50$ GOALL!!!!! DO NOT SELL HOLD AND BUY!!! UPVOTE THIS TO MAKE IT KNOWN!!!
What is a realistic but hyped squeeze target? 200?

I would squirt cum very far.
Exactly how far we talkin?
Several feet farther than you would expect.
Can nasdaq pls die today? That would be helpfull.
When GME was rocketing lots of bogus DD came out pumping BB or WISH or whatever.  Don't get distracted.  Apes Strong TOGETHER not when we are all running in different directions.  BBBY to da MOOOooooon!!!!
ugh, the sub *was* healing.
The sub goes through rebellious phases let them have their spotlight until the gas fizzles
true
Honest question why are people actively rooting against BBBY? Do you not want others to make money?
Because its fucking stupid. BBBY won't be in business in 2030. Their financials and buisness model are garbage. And this bot army comes along creating some robinhood narrative that the evil hedge funds are somehow manipulating the market and this is a chance to stick it to them.   


Meanwhile morons will yolo their student loans into it and ruin their lives. While another billionaire Cohen will take the real money any hedge fund loses.   


It's not strategic investing or rallying a squeeze. Its just gambling blindly and hoping.   


But the real reason is because GME and now BBBY ruined this SUB. These daily threads used to be filled with information and positions. You used to get yelled at if you posted a comment without positions, TICKER STRIKE AND DATE. Now its just a spam farm. I don't know why I even keep this tab open anymore other than it's an easier sentiment check than other sites. And occasionally the memes are still funny.
Cry more pussy, jeezus.
Eat a watermellon full of dicks.
They talk crap but doest buy puts
I’m holding sept $6 puts for bbby.

It’ll come down eventually.
Well assuming it doest pump to the moon like amc and gme yes u might have a chance. But if the pump starts u are doomed either way cuz no way it will go back down to 6$ if it moons.

I am not a bbby holder just so u know, i am just cheering for the 20$ melon kunis guy
It may not, they were relatively cheap when I bought them last week. But just responding to your comment that no one is buying puts.

And you’re right, if this thing pumps to $100+ it’ll take years before it sees $6 again (though I think it’ll still be $0 at some point years later). But if it fails to crack $20, I could see the following dump get down around $6 again.
New here?
Only way to make money on this shit company is to convince enough people to bid it up higher so you can get out at a higher price. Companies going bankrupt
So why does it matter to you if someone else makes money off the stock? Has zero effect on your life, unless you're short.
It’s not exactly honest. Talking up a stock for the only reason that you can sell it to others - pretty much at their expense
I dont think you're correct. The whole idea behind BBBY is that it's shorted to hell and shorts would have to close. Not even close to what you're stating.
My personal dislike agains GME, AMC, BBBY comes from the fact that you demented fucks DON'T TAKE PROFIT.

You actively oppose to making money.
Tards brag about being 2000% up and NOT CASHING it. It really grinds my gears.
Because its pure pump and dump spam. The sub becomes unusable for months when this happens.
I want you bbby!

I need you bbby!

What does knowing your gender have to do with being in the military?
Mental health issues are a very, very bad thing for a soldier to have.  This is why certain groups cannot be drafted.

I have never seen one without the other.
Agree completely, however, to deny there is a huge mental health issue in our military (just look at the suicide rate) is to deny the obvious
Yep, the military has it's own issues, but no one in power seems to care for some reason.

This is partly why recruiting rates are in the triolet (the other reason being a tight labor market).

My own thought is because it isn't profitable, or trendy to fix existing problems, but to instead chase a different flavor of pink capitalism because money is more important than people.
How long  has this been an issue? I remember it being talked about in the past 10 years, but not too much before that.

Whatever it is, it’s a damned shame.
I imagine it's been a problem for decades, but because of technology it hasn't been talked about before now.

Ryan Cohen is now either a board member or owns more than 10% of bbby either way this is huge news
350k shares to borrow just showed up. No way today's not red with that kinda firepower. Thursday and Friday are rocket days though
But the average is 63mil/day for the last 10 days. 350k is a drop in the bucket for that.. why would .5% of daily volume cause such a swing?
It's the most shares I've seen available to short since this pump started
Ok but that doesn’t answer the question
I suspect it's enough to start a massive downtrend at the start of the day which will lead to a domino effect...especially with retail and hitting stop losses. They just need to start the trend and volume will follow that direction
PLTR?
BBBY
Wow; today is red for sure, fuck it, I’ll buy nore
That’s what they want folks to think, get them to swing today then the train takes off without them. 🚂🚀🚀🚀

You’ve been on it but ur cost basis is 11 while averaging up with only 32 shares…??? Make it make sense lmao 😂
Bought in at 15.  Bought more at 9.  Bought 5 at 4.50 ish.  Bought 10 at 15
pro tip: when something doesn't go the way you thought, claiming 'it' is rigged is an immature response suitable for children and professional disgraces
Easier to cope than admit fault
I bought BBBY at 15.50 yesterday and placed a 1d banbet for $20. So I’m solely responsible for this red day we’re about to have, sorry guys.
Red or not. Still hitting $20 by eow

Not going to stay down for very long. Housing starts being down is bullish, it means the fed’s rate hike is working which means inflation is coming down.
...not at all.  It means mortgages are unaffordable so people are backing out.

Guys I want to tell you about some stock that started it’s run today. The symbol is BBBY
oh my BBBY
BOBBY.
Elon selling to buy BBBY? TSLA drilling, BBBY mooning. Only possible explanation.
Except he could buy BBBY 100 times and still be a multi-billionaire.
It would indeed be glorious if Elon caught a whiff of this and joined the fun.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880) me irl when bbby is mooning and my cool ticker isnt mooning.
what are these fucking numbers surrounded by colons
Ya mom
BBBY MY GOD!! I sold my $20 calls yesterday would’ve been 4x 😭
100k in TSLA Jan 750p (250 post split).
You caught the top perfectly, nice one
Out of my BBBY calls with another 200% for a total.of 8X on proncipal. Holding 150 shares for shits and giggles. Moving the cash to checking in the morning. If your not taking profits on the way up, you're a fucking moron.
where da positions at tho
Felt the same way when I sold GME at 32
I've lost plenty of upside over the years but if you saw my P&L for this shit, you'd shit your pants.   There's always another ride.
I had 15C' I bought last week and 9Cs from the week before. Killed it on DIS and WMT this week too. Know my personal limits and when I should be going cash gang. Which is now.
#BBBY WILL BE THE PLAY OF THE YEAR!
Omg its gonna squeeze teh sqouze
Are we selling BBBY at 420 or 1000?

My totally uninformed guess is that BBBY fights $20 until about 2:30 then a breakout
The battle for $20 again
25
BBBY is just getting started people are getting in until January I don’t know about that expiry honestly more like November 1st looking to exit
Imagine the rocket when they announce the sale of buybuybaby…
Cut my life in two pieces
This is their last big short
I liked $20 better
Trust in 🍏
Hope y’all bought that Tesla bottom…..next stop 1000
Just because? Last two falls were 300+ drops in 20 days.
This time it’s different
Because production is up? Like what's the continued bull case? Everyone else fucking up EVs at present but still having much bigger scale? TSLA has produced about 3,000,000 EVs and is valued at > 300,000 per EV. So if we're forward looking, production has to really ramp up, the rest of the market has to continue to suck, nothing bad can happen in China or Germany and the domestic market has to continue being willing to wait 6 months for an expensive EV. 1,000,000,000,000 mkt cap seems like a lot for that prospect.
Its called stonks only go up. You new here?

Never seen this many downgrade reports since GME, this shit is going paraboooooolic
Brought 1500 shares last week AH around 8s. I was so happy at the time to sell at 11 the next day.......
LOOK AT APPLE
Why?
Every fucking move I make is wrong and everything I hesitate on moons.
This is the way.
It’s not too late boi
Today I sold off all my silly little crypto investments so I could roll it into another 10 shares of BBBY.

Also kicked myself, again, for losing the $700 I made on SHIB after I forgot it existed last year. Would’ve been nice to move that into BBBY too.

Edit: Also apparently had $10 hanging out in CashApp…. Rolled that into BBBY too
Time to empty the change jar.
Soooo, my phone glitched and I can't use my thumbprint to access my CoinbasePro account. I've forgotten my password by now so I try to resest it and it sends and email to my email account. Go to my pc and pull up the email. Click on the link and CoinBase informs me it doesn't recognize my device (replaced hard drive) so I can't confirm it's me. Wants me to use device it recognizes. WTF now.
Sacrifice a llama and draw the Coinbase logo in its blood within a pentagram. Pretty sure that’s the only way

How do you decide when to take profit? Rather than hold for higher prices?
Experience from not taking profit before lol.  If something can go up this fast it can also go down just as fast.
when you take a screenshot to show someone your profit that's when you take it
I'm £4000 in profit on bbby atm, thinking to call it a day, got stung on GME lol bought in at 360 and HODL
that's good going, if you're questioning it it's probably time
£7300 now wtf
Now its £6000, can't let these emotions fuck me up lol
If its enough money to matter then consider starting to unload.
you absolute mad man, hold until $100 then buy a house on the beach, you deserve it
I question everything, but not guna have a bunch of retarded 18nyear old tell.me to hold while I get left a bag holder
I just wanted my account balance at a specific number. Nothing based on BBBY. There is no logical price target anyways, all hype. Get in, get out, be happy.
BBBY people in this thread explaining why -5% is bullish 😂
It is bullish when you're up 190% in a month
But not 195%

Opening -5% will also really fuck up calls held overnight
Not yet ....
Wont it make implied vol go up though?
Not unless more people are buying the dip then are selling, won’t know until it happens but intrinsic value alone will cause a value drop.
It's bullish AF for the $20 calls I sold yesterday.
Good shit dude, how much premium did you get?
Stock price was \~16.50 at that time. 8/19 expiration, 1.46 premium. IV was about 385%
Because it up 50% in 2 days…… -5% is not significant in PM.  Hold 🦍s 🍉🍉Hands
It is when half this sub FOMO’d in calls yesterday. Check all the people on the front page LOL

They’re all going to be down so much at 9:30 if this holds
Only a fool would believe that something that's rising 100% Plus isn't bullish
Only a fool would think it can go indefinitely
No one said it would go and definitely it's 100% Plus in a month which is literally the definition of bullish you're just a fool
The front page is full of people who FOMO’d calls yesterday. They will all be down a shitload at 9:30 if this price holds and that’s hilarious.

Remember to post lossporn when you don’t sell and get caught holding bags.
I personally didn't play this position so I will have no lost porn I don't jump in on fomo anything but the point of the matter was is you said it's not bullish and that's just stupid
It isn’t bullish because it’s going down if you can’t make that connection then something in your brain isn’t functioning and you should see a doctor
And Bitcoin wasn't bullish when it hit all time highs either cuz it had dips also. dumb guy spotted here in this post found me a real smart one
It is legitimately impossible for a stock to shoot straight up unless it's being manipulated by big money
You should put all of your money into short dated calls at open and prove me wrong then
Bro you're such a loser you down vote everything I say because you know they're all legitimate points grow up little kid fill my money don't be sad cuz you're going to miss out on all your money don't be a hater bro get your money quit hating on other people don't be such a loser
So are you not going to put all of your money into short dated calls at open to prove me wrong then?

“Miss out” on -5% lmao

Im up 45% on RKLB. I’m fine.
Good and I'm happy for you being up 45% because I'm not a hater and I'm not an idiot no I'm not going to fomo my money for any retard on Reddit that says prove me wrong I'm here to make money not to prove retards wrong
you need to pull back the slingshot to make it shoot even futher!
I don’t remember HKD doing that
bigger market, bigger slingshot.

The BBBY bot and $150 BBBY “portfolio” spamming has done more damage to WSB than GME ever did.   it’s all cyclical but this place has lost its way.

Nope. It’s cyclical. It will be found.

Just a tiny update. My feeling is that the market is in transition right now. I'm going to wait about 2 or 3 weeks to see which way it firms up.
Everything lookin kinda dumpy 😬
Sometimes we pump, sometimes we dump
im gonna dump ur mom ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Another Ryan Cohen pump and dump!
GME maintained $100+ for most of last year and this year (pre-split), and outperformed the S&P and the nasdaq 2 years in a row. Tell me how that's a pump and dump. I would've thought you'd be an expert on pump and dumps given your mother's profession, but I guess not
u mad?
Nah. I'm up today. Unlike you, probably. I'm happy

Shouldn’t this get like halted or whatever

BBBY can go very high, $200 max I think. Of course, it can go up to 300-350, since I don't have information about many things. It will definitely go up to 60-80. So is even a $30 BBBY expensive? NO! ;)
Sounds like good DD! I’m in.
I visit this thread significantly less because of bbby. It’s all I see man. It’s cool to throw money at memes but this content is getting played out![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

BBBY
(VDRL)
BBBY free float already traded 4 times over so far today
Bbby bought 1.5 shares. Hungry for a day, LFG!!
I stand in hungry solidarity with my 7 shares that I too should be eating.
My case for SPY under 200:

\- The S&P is 45% above its exponential historic trend line. P/E ratio, Buffett indicator, etc. are all near historic highs while inflation and interest rates are blasting off (yes inflation has not peaked). 45% down from where we are now implies $234. However, as we know the market does not perfectly price and emotions usually swing a market way above/below its fair price. Thus there is plenty of chance we see SPY $175 or even $150 by end of next year. Longer term puts are the play right now people, when everybody thinks the party is back. Be fearful when others are greedy. There is generational wealth to be made.
I don't think SPY will get that low, but agree that now is the time to be making bear bets.  Might be a few days or weeks early but holding a bear bet is likely to make money by EOY.
I just rainbows come out of your butthole
SPY is not gonna go below 200 shut the fuck up pls
Great counter-argument! Sound logic from a smart guy!
i just think it’s hilarious you think SPY will fall over 50% yeah I agree it can cool off but 2008 magnitude just can’t see it happening, what is the catalyst? The market is oversold? cool is has been outperforming the exponential trend line for years and years, so much more money is being invested as opposed to the 20th century
I'll be sure to come back to you after it happens
when do you think the market will correct 60% Also you never answered what the actual catalyst was
When do the hedgies have to cover their shorts?
If the price goes up high enough, they'll get margin called. This is essentinally the people they loaned their shares to saying "alright, I want my money".
whenever they want they just have to pay the fee
What is the point of fundamentals and technicals when a stock can go up exponentially for no apparent business related reasons. At this point the whole market is like a game
It’s one stock ffs just enjoy it
Open your eyes. It’s not just one stock
It’s pass the parcel for retards

GME was truly the downfall of this subreddit. Now “apes” are falling over each other to lose money on the literal worst investment possible.
I'm confused, are you saying a cash burning store doesn't have a solid future?
It has a solid future as a combo used game/theater venue. I heard there is room in that market.
What was this sub about before GME?
It was about things we can’t even say out loud anymore because now this needs to be a gentle and inclusive place given its size.
Yolos that made 27k loan guy looks like a pussy, and actually had solid dd other than short squeeze. Memes that people for some reason spent hours on, not copied and pasted from twitter.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

If people are calling this rally real then to remind you that fed hasnt started QT yet
QE didn't do anything. Therefore, QT won't do anything.

We're still facing a recession and deflation, though.
No delfation but more inflation. Recession yes which is caused in some part from huuge QE which pumped the market you fucking retard
QE psyched the market. QT doesn't need to psych the market. That's because QE didn't actually do anything.

Deflation is coming.
You ARE retarded.
Why do you say that?
JPow might disagree with you.
He hopes he has a psychological effect. That's all he's got.

Someone posted yesterday to buy stonks, not options, as the latter will put downward pressure on the stonk price. Does that mean it will be better to exercise any ITM call options that I currently hold?
You’ll lose extrinsic value.   Better to sell the options and buy shares with the profit if that’s what you wanna do.
Bought more puts on TSLA

/u/MostHumbleToEverLive (3W/1L) made a bet that BBBY would go to 18.23 when it was 15.85 and it did, congrats gigabrain.
I like the stock! Bobby! Fuck me!
TSLA, 890 or 950. Get your shit together.
FUBO double digits gains.  So close to 5.  This was a 35 dollar stock less than a year ago.
APRN and FUBO has squeeze potential as well
Every bear that was doubting BBBY you and ur moms a hoe
I want to hear Andrew Tate analyze the Better Call Saul ending
I have only watched breaking bad couldn't get into this show. I will give it a try again. Is it any good
Better than a lot of shit out there

Lots of filler and a lackluster “made for TV” ending

B-
Just a casual up 390% day. The usual.
So it’s safe to say this pump will be short lived since I bought calls. Gotta take one for the team.

Go baBBBY go!
Volume is 🍌🍌
So i missed the GME times, where can this realistically go?
idk, buy or fomo there is zero in between
Moon
Up
Up
0 is guarantee but for now who knows
no one knows
Only up right now. YOLO
Only up right now. YOLO
Only up right now. YOLO

For reference.  GME Short interest was 140% and it went to $500.  BBBY short interest is about 42%.
incredibly frustrating that the only 'play' to make right now means hoping a meme stock doesn't randomly collapse at the first sign of instability.
Next target : $69

Shhhhh. It’s coming.

Dont tell them. They deserve to lose everything
#TAKE YOUR NONSENSE TO THE MEGATHREAD
With the thousands of shares everyone is screaming about buying, the volume is going to dry up because no one will have any funds left to keep buying. This shitshow may be short lived
If you think retail is the driving force behind BBBY trading double the shares in existence in a single day, I’ve got some fantastic meth for you to try.
That's the problem, where will the money to buy at 17, 18, 19... 60, 80 etc. come from?

At some point earlier buyers will want to sell because the underlying is a piece of shit.

That's why GME/AMC don't really go anywhere now.

It was easy before because the market cap was smallish.
Does Biden ever get tired of throwing tax money at people who spend their own money unwisely? 🤔
It's the cheapest way he can buy votes.

#GME DIE, BBBY FLY
Best part of Burry dumping is he didn't just do it yesterday or last week, did it pretty much at THE bottom lol.  Won't be making a movie about that Cassandra call.
Set my alarm for 5am to buy more. Two days in a row now. A $5 avg was pretty, but more shares is prettier.
Gl bbby dip, just wait till 160m volume kicks in

Can someone explain the connection between Ryan Cohen and BBBY?

Cant find a good reason to jump on the train

He likes the stock
Owns 10%
He likes the stock.
He's their #1 customer.
Own like 20% of the company
Bought in at $15

Yuuuge following 

Gme at $160 pps before stock split almost still 2 years after initial queef

BBBY fired CEO, doing similar pattern of restructuring similar to gme 

Apes DIE HARD
Don’t dude, watch from the side lines
What percentage of bbby shills actually sold gme at a profit?
Shut up you little weasel 

Tell the mayo man we coming for him
Not you then I take it?

B riley shorted bbby and wants us to sell whoever the fuck that is make them suffer hodl
Just a heads up. When GME was squeezing Tuesdays and Wednesdays were either flat or red. The squeeze pressure only really matters on Monday, Thursday and Friday
Post gme jan 2021 pump, “memestocks” actually had some rocketships on the second day of the week. Gme and amc, flat “second days of the week” until megapumps showed up here and there.

i love the future of hand towels ! I like the stock BBBY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Either keep BBBY above 10.50 so I can get the full premium on these covered calls I sold you all, or have it drop to 10.49 on Friday so I can sell another round to you apes. Then we can all make money!
I’d throw in another 100k at 10.99
Feeling FOMO even with my almost 300 shares lol.
Right? I'm cursing the fact all my money is already in.

I was up last year 800k then I lost it and turn it into 1.2 million loss =(

When will I make back my 13 million?
wannabe hedge fund

lmao
T\_T  I was up to 13 million in august of 2020. I was in GME too. =( I sold it thinking the squeeze would happen around earnings time of first quarter and wanted to multiply my mulha even more.
Ok, I read the actual link you posted and its kinda sad but you get through this. On the bright side of things, you'll probably have enough losses for a lifetime and any future gains are basically tax free for a while.

Also sounds like you're still well off financially.
Username checks out
I actually had a big call position in GME but sold in December before the big rally. =( I would have made \~70 million if it kept it. I keep having bad luck =(
More 6 sigma moves?  This market has been rough for theta with the number of 2% or greater days.

forever
a couple weeks probably
Ready to not learn my lesson and not sell any BBBY until it’s worth nothing but loving these 9/23 20c I have
Sold at $18.35 expecting to buy the inevitable dip. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
We are heading for $70
So wmt lowered and sandbagged guidance made some insider over 13 million dollars on puts and then beat estimates anyway. Nothing to see here.
You really think the market’s rigged because a multiBILLION dollar company had price fluctuations and made some guy a few million?
I never said it was I just find it funny all of those things happened. They lowered guidance. Tanked the price. An insider bought just minutes before closing bell WEEKLY puts over a million dollars in a block trade and sold them for 13x his money. They also beat their sandbagged guidance. 

Is anything I said false or alluding to rigged? You put the words in my mouth
Inverse Cramer but not when he’s on your side. 

-Ape logic
20 would be a blessing
40,000 OI on the 45c’s, unironically going there by eow if not eod.
I think BBBY tests $20 by Thursday, if it breaks through, Friday will be unlimited fomo.
Banbet it
I've got $50k in 8/26 13c's ..
Today
I hope not, I got dips too buy
People thought that on june 2nd for amc, “it’s a tuesday, dip day but maybe we’ll go 10%”

The damn stock went like over 100% in a day. If bbby is going to cause someone pain, they’re gonna rip the bandaid off fast so they can make money from iv and theta.
How are people not buying all the DTC (Solo Brands) shares? That stock is RIPE AF.

This is rich. I needed a good laugh today.

Good luck with your interview, "business owner". Sucks to be burnt out and about to quit your job, don't take it out on me.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND ITS SCAWWWWYYYY OLD MAN
I’m not making any predictions one way or another on BBBY but the fact that y’all think you’re in control of this run up is funny. This price movement isn’t driven by retail.

Bulls should find solace in the fact that film studios will pay them a small compensation when they'll hire background actors for The Big Short II. Always helpful to pay rent.
Bulls pay mortgages, not rent
You baggies need to understand that after a 150M volume day, whatever shorts are left are highly unaffected by price. You'd need to pump so much FOMO long to then get a very low volume of short capitulation at the end relative to bagholding created. Please learn from the SEC report. Also, BBBY has much worse fundamentals than gamestore. Either way, keep pumping it and they will dilute.
U dont seem to understand that hedgies are joining in this pump after seeing retail fomo and the 20$ watermelon fucking post.
We don’t need your science
They will dilute but not any time soon
Why would they fucking dilute now after buying back all those shares? lmao
Because they need money. They don't even have enough money to survive next quarter at the rate they burn cash.
This is the start of the second leg down. We are going below $350.

BBBY overrated. IV too high go make the good gains

$20 weekly calls only went ~120% on a fucking 20% underlying move

My TSLA 900p are up 120% on normal intraday action.
But are you having fun?
Yeah, fuckin rush. Down 30% then up 100% in like 5 minutes
That’s what counts
Took profit when TSLA hit 911 on 920ps I bought earlier. Sitting back and relaxing rest of the day 😴

i don’t understand how walmart missed eps but beat rev by so much can anyone explain?
Rev is rev. 

EPS is the earnings metric. It’s Rev minus costs and other liabilities like taxes and all that and then multiplied with the outstanding shares. 

So they got more rev, but less profit. So they have more costs to get more rev. Why? Can be different things (higher taxes, more costs due to shipping, more costs due to more employees, etc). 

Or they offered more shares. That’s also a possibility.
More shares with the same profit is less EPS. 

Just the basics, but it’s more than that.
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

if you swallow you good
Walmart reporting better than expected isn’t a good thing. It means the consumer is still strong. I work retail as well, and we’re down from last year, but not by much. People are still spending money. And like Walmart, we’ve eaten a lot of cost increases that we plan on pushing along once inventory issues get resolved. This means this supposed “decrease” is merely a small pull back. Inflation is going to continue to run hot. Once the SPR stops flooding the market with gas energy prices will sky rocket again, and the Fed will continue to jack rates. This is not FUD. This is fact.
I routienly take macro financial advice from Retail workers. I hear wendys has a sweet place to meet up when your shift ends... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Don’t sell bbby til we hit 21 at least and take off stop losses
I don’t set those. I just forget about it until I check and see that I’d be up if I sold hours ago.
Hope this premarket dump isn't fake for once
Lol it is
Yeah, I have a feeling it is again. This shit is just cruel for the bears. Fake dump just before open to give some false hope
All dips are bought calls are the infinite money glitch for months now
For months? I think you are a bit too optimistic.
I mean the market has directly rocketed up since June opex pretty much from 362 to 429
Yeah, I did but will that continue for much longer? Especially when some stocks are already near their ATH like AAPL for example.
I mean I'm bearish on the market but it legit has retard strength constant rally on no volume at all. There are more puts on the market than June 2020 it's crazy. Every dip is bought and AAPL is just propping this market up massively. Either it's going to collapse spectacularly and a massive put gamma ramp will print or it's going to actually short squeeze an index for the first time ever
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Rip FOMO BBBY.
And this is why you don’t FOMO into meme stocks
Why is that again?
FOMOs going to the moon too bro
Wrong again, bucko.
because you don't like money?
I read this comment, then opened my other tab to see that BBBY is up 11¢
Well I sold all my shares at 17.8 so just come back down to around 15-16 now and I’ll buy back
This is my first time doing stocks, bought 168 at 5.77 when should I sell? Is it really going to go up to 80 or is it everyone being regarded? What are calls and who is Ryan Cohen???
It’s probably not going to $80. Sell enough to cover however much the position cost you and some profit, let some ride 🤷🏻‍♂️
Just hold till Friday if it drops 2 days in a row I would sell you have a low buy in so you have time
Nobody knows. If I were you I’d set a stop loss where ever you comfortable. Google that if you don’t know what it is
You're gonna hear everyone saying just keep holding. I'll drop the meme for a minute and tell you what I actually do. I have limit sells set at $50 for a handful of shares. At $50, these shares will be worth what I spent to buy ALL my shares. So if we reach $50 and my limit sells trigger, I will have, at the VERY LEAST broke even. After that, it's up to me to decide when I think we're about to hit the peak and I should sell the rest of my shares. I'll probably be wrong, but that's life.

That being said, you should also yolo your life savings into BBBY and HODL to the moon.
Is this real lol
Profit is profit
if you're that worried, take out your initial investment and hodl with the rest
$BBBY TO 50$ GOALL!!!!! DO NOT SELL HOLD AND BUY

Seee ya!
I’ll be back ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
There's not gonna be a major dip. Doubt it can get lower than $19 or $18. I sold my shares at $12, waited for the dip but ended up buying back at $16.
Yeah I set a price alert to 17-18. I’ll go in with a reduced position here.

Why is it in Europe that if you try and go clubbing and your older than like 20 you kinda feel like an old man?

And then If your over 25 the bouncers pretty much laugh at you when your trying to get into a club and usher you away while saying something in German that means “The brothel is down that way you old codger” .. it’s as if your a 75 year old horn dog trying to pick up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)

The holier-than-thou macro bear community has conveniently switched their entire narrative to Europe, given that we came away with a soft landing. Walmart confirmed no recession. Inflation plummeting.

U need to understand the term bearish a 0.1 0.2 move is not bearish 🤣 we opened -0.6 on premarket and is now -0.1 that is bullish my friend

We opened -0.6 in premarket its -0.3 now if my maths is correct we have -0.3 to go before we even make a lower low than premarket

My company's stock is terribly out of favor with Wall St and piled on by bears.  Where's our short squeeze?
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

!banbet spy 420.01 3 days
Bear trap
Remember how these random tickers like KOSS and others used to move with GME? KIRK is doing the same for BBBY
REDDDDD
probably go to 50up
Spy wants down
bruh volume is nuts today
“Bruh”


🤡🤡
BBBY only 1.2 b mk cap, easily worth 12 bil meaning $200 a share on fundamentals alone. squeeze should take it to 20,000 a share.

already looking up islands.
LG BoBBY!
APRN moving bigly
Ready to not learn my lesson and not sell any BBBY until it’s worth nothing but loving these 9/23 20c I have
$60 bbby wen ?
Walmart ceo said that even the rich shop in walmart now. Rip economy
Been seeing a few more high end vehicles at my Walmart.
Been seeing a few more high end vehicles at my Walmart.
Lol so who is shopping at target now?
Ok so we already broke the $20 EOW goal, keep pushing til it hits $50 EOW? 🚀
115million in volume. My tits are jacked 🚀🚀🚀
Next target : $69
RISEEEEE BOBBY RISEEEE
Spy following bbby
Is Gamestonk still alive?
Its immortal.

Gme still main squeeze play fyi

Bbby gains roll into gme drs shares.

Hedgies hate this trick
I can’t cum no more. You’re sucking me dry ugghhhh
I support short sellers.
No you don't. You're here!
Hedgies are pumping doge as a distraction. Do not sink your money into it right now. There will be other times
Felt like I just woke up two years ago
lol
Wrong group bud
Doge is just pumping because all the bullshit assets are pumping.
Fuck your calls bulls get fuckkkeddd!!
Lmao okay

As soon as this rally fades, we drill to earths core. And it just started
I’ll give it a week
Seen this comment everyday for 2 months now
Yeah and now the momentum is gone. Volume is dead. Fear and greed can change rather quickly.
Every single thing is priced out.
#GME DIE, BBBY FLY, GME DIE, BBBY FLY
Bobby getting gaped
Let's clear the air, Adam Aron and Ryan Cohen are not your friends and are more like the hedgies you despise rather than the apes you wish them to be
if they make me money, then they're my best friends
They are making themselves money at the expense of the apes
if they make me money, then they're my best friends
AA yes, RC no
One of these guys is not like the other.

Why do you want people to dump their BBBY shares so much?
Bears assemble…

Might go back to some of your high schools and find that “pledge to not say the r word” poster you signed and black mail you for large sums of money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
? I never signed any retarded shit like that
wtf is the R word
We didn't go to retard academy like you, no poster existed
This guy gen-z's
If bbby Hits 20 maybe ryan conman  turns the air CONDITIONER back on
Is there no air con in Bobby now?

#$wmt > bobby
We can buy both bbby and lulu. One is a low end rarely visited retail stores, the other is the opposite. It helps to balance out
Hedgies using major news outlets (CNBC, Yahoo, etc) in addition to usual analyst ratings to smear BBBY.  Targeting the retail investors rather than the traders.  HODL
Un fucking real.. Just continuous buying every single day fuck this
What do you think the stock market is?
GME IS SHIT AND SQUOZE

BBBY IS NEXT

GME IS SHIT AND SQUOZE

#Inflation topped. Stonks gonna moon, fed gonna pause rate hikes, 25 bps final hike on September
Oh my dear, sweet child.
#Post your puts loss, ride call trains bruh
Oh I'm in calls right now. Was in puts before. Making money each way. But you're delusional to think feds aren't continuing high rate hikes.
What’s your thesis on calls? Delusional to expect spy to rally and expecting rate hikes to continue
I play weeklies or less. I'm not in anything for long term. Right now we're rallying so I'm in calls, but long term I'm bearish and think we still have quite a ways we should fall. If we start dropping next week or the week after, I'll be in puts.
No chance
# Inflation topped. Stonks gonna moon, STFU
[I warned everyone yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wovnu0/_/ikf0xaz/?context=1)

Downvotes won’t make your $30c weeklies any less dumb or red at open

STAND DOWN!
How can you say that 50 times a day and not cringe?

Even the bears are bulls
I remember when folks were waiting for amc to pull back, they even thought it would happen on june 2nd, exact opposite happened
Doom! Yall be homeless before next week.
Instead of bbby. Let’s all just buy lulu instead. I like lulu calls
ohhhhhh yes bbby lemme see that sweet little lulu

This is only the beginning.

The real crash comes in the afternoon.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How gay can you be
its up 11% what are you smoking
So glad I dumped all my bbby shares last week
F
Just another pump and dump I won’t make money on, it’s disgusting to watch
BBBY bag holders about to be sad
Those heavy ass bags full of 201% gains? Get fucked
You won’t sell though ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Not til at least $20
Your mum can hold my ball bags
😡
You know this a silly meme thread right
Guys, real quick thing everyone should do just to be safe. Set a stop loss for bbby. But set it super low. This is just in case this drops way too low you still save some of your initial investment.

Hit sell, then select “limit” (this is the limit of how low you’re willing to let it go). Set a low limit, like $10 or less. Do this for the entire qty of shares you hodl.

Trying to protect y’all fellow apes!
Good Idea, I'll set mine to $100 just in case it drops
Funny you think most apes got in below $10.

TLRY is the play today.  Got 5k shares at 4.20 yesterday.
As an owner of 550 shares, even I think BBBY is finished. Momentum dies today. $9.45 by EOW
Got proof of your 550 shares?
Show me your hot cousins tits first
I don't think your mum would be comfortable with me posting them
Weird
Positions or ban
Odd for someone holding 550 shares has been doing nothing but shitting on BBBY for the last 2 weeks - which is how long the account has been alive for. Veeeeery odd
When BBBY crashes it will take the market with it - get ready
Looks like bbby is crashing
Big old -2% on low volume in PM after 23.5% in a day…
Spy apparently cares what Walmart and home Depot are up to nowadays.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
BBBY was supposed to keep dumping so I could get more cheaper! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
Buy at open

Wtf ??? You’re dumb af

Ryan Cohen is a bad actor. Be careful

BBBY shills in here saying there “buying lambos” when the stock is up 33%

…and the calls are only up a wopping 200% ![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)
Don’t be bitter friend.
Its okay to lose money, you don’t need to take it out on us
i dont own it or trade it

dont get butthurt about the reality of it

200% on a 33% underlying move is awful. anyone who regularly trades derivatives knows this
Don’t be bitter friend.
$WMT > BoBBY
The end is near for BBBY cause this bear just jumped in.  Can't argue with volume
Under 20 now. Gonna drop to 15 now
Ok bud
Bet
Shut the fuck up shill
I hope bbby goes down 80% today and I don’t even have puts
Same. I just want to see the ape spammers eat dik
That’s like saying “i hope gme goes down” when it was sub 30.
why don’t u buy outs for it? don’t believe in urself?
Yea I don’t, I’ve lost 40k on options the last two years
puts*
Spy is done sold BBBY we crashing
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Lmao at the bulls acting like that weak ass WALMART earnings report is gonna lift this house of cards market. WMT up only 3% premarket, it's gonna fade to red by open and the market is def going down today.
This guy: ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
Delusion is sad man, please stop
![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)
I'm sorry you bought puts but that seems more like a personal problem than a market problem
The only thing going down is me behind the Wendy’s
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Fuck the Waltons
Agreed
In memeory of bbby I will be watching king of the hill today
Dat ticker ain’t right boy
I have a huge boner thinking of the crying, panicking and self bargaining I am going to see on here when the BBBY rug is pulled out.
I got in at 8.  Dumped yesterday.
This is the way

60x150c 9/2 wmt. Am I fuk?
Yes
That's a bit high of a strike, depending on when you bought them. Should be up today 30-40%
Yesterday for .17 ea
Slowly scaling out of all my shit and getting ready to put a good chunk into SQQQ to try to ride it back down over a month or so
Till then it’s just memes and Chinese money laundering
Won’t see 15 again till after squeeze
Tesla will irrationally run into the stock split, then I'm buying October puts with my entire account.
Can’t wait for this to finally dump
Might be waiting a while
bbby not moving ahhhh

nevermind my app was broken yeeeeeeeeeee
I’m gonna short this down all day today me make money bulls buy at the top
Facebook has crippled the ability to see or view events even further than normal recently.  This was the best remaining feature.  What product manager decided that being able to go to a businesses page and see what events they were hosting quickly and clearly was somehow a bad experience?  

Facebook Millennials can't even let me know if there is music at the distillery tonight and somehow think people are going to buy into their "metaverse".
Duuuuump

The WSB voice chat is very neg on $bbby

TSLA to tap 900 today!
Y![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Market is pulling back and you can only fight the market so many days in a row. APEs pulling their TSLA profits to pile into BBBY. Issues domestic and abroad. It's also up 50% in 2 months so some sort of pull back was inevitable
Wouldn’t advise buying calls until FOMC minutes
Powell going to pump the everliving fuck out of the market without even meaning to
Hold strong my fellow qqq bears
U can try to make a mega thread but Bobby will spread its seed!!
SST about to pop. Low float $25 million buy backs. Cheap options. Can get on this early before IV is jacked up. Also happy for the BBBY crew
REV is flying again. Just going to go higher
Big BBBY crash today
ban bet it
Sell as quick as possible. Daddy needs a new dip
You mean big BBBY opportunity today

Closed half my BBBY positions.

Aged like milk
I can't wait until BBBY never squeezes and we a can laugh at the tens of thousands of baghodlers ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Let’s go, BBBy Friday 12.5p, got one of them, gonna print
Rug pull would be epic
Some people just want to see the world burn .
Pump and dump is not watching the world burn.
It is if you don't have a stake in either.
Good luck brother, I hope you pull out from your stake on profits . All the best 👌
Is FUBO in the earlier stages of a BBBY-esque run? Might be worth a gamble
Bbby is in the early stages of bbby
Why gamble when the sure bet is BBBY?
As much as I love BBBY, can we keep it to the megathread?
SELL RYAN CONMAN TRASH STOCKS AND BUY TESLA
Sorry guys but I feel like this is it for BBBY

Bye
Oh boo it’s down 4 percent
Bbby not looking very strong today
It starts out almost everyday with a sell off then comeback
Watch
not even 15 min into the day and it has ridiculous volume and is currently up 2% from close yesterday. tf you talking about bro
Hate me if you want, but puts on BBBY are the move…
Why
Too much hype right now buddy otherwise I would normally agree
Mods plz do something about this bbby nonsense atleast give them their own thread
You are just mad because you ran out of the allowance your gf's boyfriend gives you every month and now you have to sit on the sidelines while the cool kids are having fun.
I'm not mad I'm happy for y'all I just want wsb back
lol, oh you.... new here?
You have 2 choices right now BBBY noobs

You can take profits before the scumbags who are trying to make you the bagholder

You can “hold” as they tell you to. They’ll sell very soon. And you’ll lose it all

There’s no honor among thieves. You’re not fighting Hedgies you’re playing musical chairs. Plan accordingly
> They’ll sell very soon. And you’ll lose it all

Fear

> There’s no honor among thieves.

Uncertainty 

> You’re not fighting Hedgies you’re playing musical chairs. 

Doubt

Too regarded. Bought more.
So cocky and arrogant right now and then for the next year you’ll whine about manipulation for why you’re losing money
I’ve 20X my original GME position from Jan 21 and am up nicely. 

🤔
I made half a million on GME bitch boy

A ponzi is a ponzi and having no exit strategy is stupid
Ohh bitchboy! Spicy.

I don’t think they let you purchase shit on a play money account tho..
People who mention percent gains and not dollar gains have $5 accounts

Did you turn $10 into $200?
So how deep in the short hole are you?
Dammit BoBBY, stay down! I'm trying to buy more on the cheap.
Ryan cohen hasn’t added any value but fucking nfts to his companies, but he is pretty good at pump and dumping, I’ll give him that.
Have you seen a pump and dump that looks like this? 😆
I pissed at myself for only buying $1K worth of BBBY puts yesterday
Go all in on those at open and show us the results ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Don’t worry… you’ll be thankful it was only $1k later when the market is open.
Some WS executive will buy himself a new yaht with your money apes.
maybe they’ll buy you a dictionary while they’re at it
Shhh I might actually be able to afford a yaht
when they are missing a "c" they are considerably cheaper
Yawt
That's how all pump and dumps work, a small percentage will make out big while others will be left with the bag, mostly retail.

Maybe even the company itself will take advantage with an offering, cough Li, cough GME, cough AMC.

But if you say that "shorts" will be left with the bag for some reason instead of retail, all of a sudden it becomes cool again and these idiots will hold your $100 GME bags.
It would be fun to see gme and Bbby apes fight each other
Why you hitting yourself?
PEOPLE BUYING BBBY BECAUSE THEY CANT AFFORD A TESLA SHARE
Tesla sucks! Can't even compare to upcoming  bbby gainz
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
and is there anything wrong with that?
Bbby puts should print right?
Amc puts did not print all summer 2021
no both calls and puts gonna get fk
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Looks like the red is already starting lmao. How low will the dip go?
How long is a string?
Question is… is it attached to a tampon? And what size tampon?
I’m long bbby but why do people think it will run like gme did when 140% of the float was sold short?
Told y’all to buy Amtd yesterday
Building less houses due to inflation record breaking recession 


Means



Currently built houses go up even more :) especially in remotely desirable areas YEAHHHHHHHH BUDDY
Housing needs to come down, but it can take it’s time. I’ve enjoyed seeing my net worth balloon because I own a nice house in a desirable neighborhood.
I don’t get it. The climate bill adds a minimum 25% to some stocks bottom line retroactively to the beginning of the year and they are barely up over the last month. Realistically their earnings will double due to the bill.
Either the market is wrong or the market priced in favorable legislation to their valuation already. Pick one.
what stonks specificaly?
Clean energy fuels
no one cares cuz they know the bill wont actually do shit
The credits flow right into the companies accounts….
BBBY -5%, Call options -50% 💀
Time to jump in? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Guys actually belive this is a rally while volume is dead for weeks
Volume has been insane for weeks wtf you talking about?
In bizarro world?
Or u trading nas?
Or u trading nas?
This is the first time I've ever been hoping a stock goes down (BBBY) because I am so sure it's going to rise, and I want to buy it at a discount
TSLA bout to break loose
Remember how many bag holders were prevented by disabling the buy the button. Hopefully vlad comes thru for ya again
Watch out...battle zone here.  Fully expect a massive drop.
take your BBBY comments to its dedicated thread
Ur annoying
I’m a gay bear ig cuz I sold my calls at the top, I’ll take my +150% tyvm
All in spy330 puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
How are we feeling about $MEGL?
So is everyone going to take profits and rotate into spy puts and 10x their bbby
BBBY is not a $20 stock
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You’re right, it’s $1,000 stock
You’re right it’s a 100 dollar stock
Its a $200 stock
STAND DOWN!!!
Bulls getting DESTROYED just as I predicted.
Bbby up 22% broke thru 20$ while nasdaq down 1% i wont call that destroyed![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Fuck your "we" bullshit
I know the moment I buy bbby it will crash
I took care of that for yiy, buy my dip
Go ahead I need to load up more on discount.
Count me in. Let‘s ride and fall together.
So buy puts and make the rest of the sub happy. It's really the least you could do

Fuck UBS

Thanks for that, probs gonna listen to Dookie now
Spy puts at $430 or wait to see if $440 is possible ??  I’m talking 2023 and 2024 puts
431 all in
resistance is very strong at 430. spy maybe failed test and crash.
I’m afraid we test 430 today and retrace to like 426 eod just to fly through 430 eow. I know it’s going to come down but it’s like this market is strong rn with not much bearish sentiment near term
low volume but spy keep going up.  It try to go up 430 yesterday, but it can't hold 429. I don't think that It can break out 430 today. My prediction will go down 425 today.
Lookin for a meme video posted a couple months ago. About 2:00 long



It was a green day/market pop/to the moon vid with e.g. rocket man and Vibe Cat

If you don't know which one it is I'm taking all good vibes WSB meme vids with Vibe Cat
Filter by meme
Man they’ve held futes here all night
I had been planning to sell half of my TSLA shares, optimistically hoping for them to break 1000 again as the point I'd sell (acknowledging that may be dreaming)

With the upcoming split, what do you suggest, for someone trying to exit my TSLA position (or at least 50% of it)?
Sell premium all day long until it gets over 1000. If it hits that strike and you sell your shares win win right?
what does sell premium mean? I'm not too knowledgeable about this stuff
Only works if you have shares in 100 increments. Selling calls/puts
History suggests you should exit before the split
thanks, appreciate the suggestion
If your expecting a pullback like last time, why not just sell calls itm?
To be fair I read this wrong I thought you had 1000 shares then was thinking wait, what regard with 1000 Tesla shares would be in WSB asking for advice
Pullback

are puts so expensive because there aren't many shares to borrow?

trying to figure out why calls are cheaper than puts.
Puts are expensive because the CTB is baked into the price and because more people want downside insurance than upside potential.

Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

Stock market priced in interest rates decline. Forex market priced in the opposite. We all know forex is more reliable
Eu rising rates, uk rising rates, yet us has been raising rates since nov so i guess eu and uk is playing catch up while us is playing with a timebomb
I think in europe inflation will run havoc. Europe has no intention to keep up. It's a trade off between recession/depression and inflation. That's why Euros are crashing for month.
Absurd market behavior the last weeks. Inflation still at record level and market marches towards ath...
Well a war with russia, and roaring inflation with a country with low export and high import, they are out of moves at this point they can only hope that oil imports from saudi gets in faster and ease up inflation cuz if they hike too much they would just kill the economy into depression
True. But I think oil will explode soon. Many people in europe didn't buy heating oil and with dutch ttf 2000% above normal many will switch to oil. Dutch ttf made more than 10% alone this day. The economy is heading into a god damn deep depression. Qt over the last decade was only possible because energy crashed in 2014. So the money printing didn't impact inflation ratios. I think most people didn't realize the deep cracks in the system and the hidden shifts in economies and powers.
Well oil demand is going down and its going down hard, china, india, saudi and other asean countries are buying up all the russian oil then repackaging it for self use or imports to eu and us. And there has been breakthroughs in the liquid gas industry as eu look for alternatives so alot of smaller eu nations are pumping out more liquidfy gas to ease supply. While china economy is crashing and production just hit a -10% this month so their demand for gas has also decrease. All of these data point to a decrease in gas price, the eu"s real battle now isnt really gas prices anymore as the oil from saudi and us will soon arrive their real battle is in the forex market where the euro is tanking so hard, they import alot from foriegn countries so a low euro is fuckking up their citizens.
Inflation didn't explode so far cuz many states in europe subsidiesed oil and gas. Many states won't be able to do this much longer. Especially with rising yields
Yup, inflation is easing alrd canada alrd had a 3rd month lower inflation print today so rhings seem to be turning for the better

Like there are a bunch of shitty memestocks that are branded as the next gme and amc but they will dumped and u will get trapped anyway if u are greedy for ez money u might want to learn to invest rather than looking for the next memestock craze
I don't put my whole portfolio, or even a majority. I literally keep about 20-25% of my portfolio maxed to play risky stocks and pull the trigger when necessary before it gets out of hand. I'm definitely not an amateur since I have been outperforming all the markets YTD, and even before BBBY.

Tesla went down to $919 to chase that HUGE buy order.  I could be wrong, but looks like $949 (next major sell wall) back on the menu.  Cool to see it happen live in the order book.
I threw another K at it at 18.43 dammit 
No fear it’s gonna bounce higher
Close at 1969
Off to the freaking races, boys. I’m dubious but I put $500 in just for shits and giggles.
Is there any actual way (not bullshit assumptions) to know what short positions are in and at what prices? Like, if you have a bunch of shorts at $40, it's far less useful that if they're at $15
No way unfortunatly
Well the megathread didn't work now there's TWO threads being spammed to death lmao.
wow   whats going on with TSLA?  my TSLA $940 8/19/22 Call just dropped like crazy

Guys, real quick thing everyone should do just to be safe. Set a stop loss for bbby. But set it super low. This is just in case this drops way too low you still save some of your initial investment.

Hit sell, then select “limit” (this is the limit of how low you’re willing to let it go). Set a low limit, like $10 or less.
Lol this guy
Setting a stop that low is just a sell the dip button

Depends on how serious you want to make money.

You want to actually profit? Buy shares or long-dated options on bluechip companies like AAPL, MSFT and the like and wait. It's boring but a cash machine.

Can’t wait to buy BBBY puts. This is eventually gonna have a -30 or 40% day. No one even goes to this store.
You’re actually re+arded if u think going to the store is the basis for this play
Don’t stand in front of a moving train
This has zero to do with the value of the company ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
It's hard to time this thing w/ puts
Come on BBBY, dump you piece of shit, I want that asshole that put $2M on you to lose it all, he doesn’t deserve to win
Not gonna happen
Yes he does, and I'm hitchin a ride, I'll send you a postcard from Pluto 🚀🚀🚀
Oh no, bbby is falling?! Maybe y'all can stfu and bring good ol wsb back
It’s not
I don’t see a fall, sir

ouch that iv crush,  glad i sold bbby yesterday
Weird my contracts are up from yesterday. Even the OTM options
Um actually my calls r up without any price change so IV has increased
when we gonna sell bbby?
4 digits
420
the fun part: we don't
Whenever you want. What do you think this is?
it isnt even the money at this point. This market just makes me sad cause I worry the bulls and long term investors will never learn their lesson if it keeps going  


they think they're right, not just a stopped clocked at a particular time of day. and thats fucked up. they need to learn.

&#x200B;

for their own good and so we don't have to listen to their bullshit
BBBY fuck they killed it.

You sell when you want
After the split
Everybody sell everything!!
That's it for today guys. Smart people take their money and put it in good stocks. 

Same shit as GME, AMC,...
Looks, Feels, like a bull trap
that's been said every day for like 2 weeks. 

when it finally falls after hitting 420.69, all the bears will be yelling, "see, I told you!" from behind the wendy's dumpster
I’m buying more puts
go ahead.

Cashing out of $BBBY slowly and going heavy on $Fubo time for them bears to die but will keep some bbby runners for that run to 30?
Those my 2 biggest plays currently as well
I don’t know why these fucking idiots are downvoting a Jesus Christ I guess I’ll sell them my BBBY calls at 10 X lol
Brother and sister TgL and MeGL are running this morning! Enjoy the ride 🎢
How heavy are your bags?
Pre-Market BBBY has started a TTM Squeeze on the 5 Min Chart, I will watch to see if it fires & moves up in timeframe! When a TTM Squeeze happens it means theres a lot of Volatility in the market & the price could break out strongly up or down after consolidating in a tight trading range!
So... The meme stock is volatile and it can go either up or down... Genius.
Crazy that ber r just ded. They're not even here anymore it seems.

I'm annoyed they're making us bool into necrophiliacs, because as if being dead weren't enough for them after this month, they're being dead and getting fucked by us during the Pelosi mid term pump festival. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Just a slow and steady non obvious buy of SNAP by large financial institutions on behalf of the Biden Administration to the Kingdom of SA.  And smart retail hopping on board also.   No stopping until minimum 15 but likely 20.

As a company they are trash. I interviewed with them years back for an analytics manager position and they all bragged about working 50-60 hour weeks like that was going to entice me to want to work there. Left the panel interview and emailed the recruiter a thank you, but I would not be proceeding any further with them.

Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

Pinned

It hit $17.40 for brief moment!
17.99
I've never been more happy to be corrected!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)kinky
EOD you're gonna laugh at how low this was.
I’m banking on $69.420 EOD
Sounds like a great TP. Im in.
Already laughing
haa
20$![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
$24!

Just commenting so someone gets to correct me when it goes even higher!

Get fucked hedgies!
$28!!
Then it hit $20.73 😂
I come from the future. It has surpassed 20 dollars a share. Rejoice.
I saw $17.99
Bit ch it's 19.76 now!
20.71*
Am I too late or should I be buying more
I feel bad for $27k loan guy.
Yolo 27k loan and put a stop loss? That is beyond regarded
Big time bitch move
especially since hedgecucks can see your orders through PFOF. it wouldnt be impoosible if his 27k trade got found on here and they got his stop loss. they literally text and email each other wsb threads as found in court documents.
Bed bath and beyond retarded?!
bad bathsalt and beyond resonable volume and price action omg my titties
I hope people removed their stop loss. HF can manipulate it to crash using people's stop loss. It's what they did when GME was mooning last year.
Scared money don't make money
Scared that I don’t make money
Bro he invested about 10$ and sl at 9$ something, would be almost 27k profit rn💀
never feel bad for someone else's increased brain power.
What's the story?
some guy took out a 27k loan from the bank and went all in in BBBY, it dipped one day and it triggered his stop loss. went down from 27k to 24k. it soared soon after

edit

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wkzd91/why_you_shouldnt_take_out_a_27k_loan_to_buy_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I thought it triggered after he lost 3k, leaving him with 24k?
i stand corrected
it didn't go from 27k to 3k. It sold when he was down 3k. So 27k -> 24k
Fuck
I think he was down like 15% or something and sold with a stop loss. On a volatile stock. 💀
broke even and sold iirc
He didn't even break even. He lost $3000 on the first day and panic sold
Someone posted that they took out $27k in loans to buy, they got cold feet when it went down for a day, and since then it's mooned.
I don't. He should've learned to not put stop losses after what happened to GME on march 10th of last year. Also, how are u gonna put a 10-20% stop loss on a stock that swings so violently? Just this morning we went from -5% to +5% back to red back to +10% in like 10 mins. I feel like if ur gonna invest in stocks like this, or really anything, you gotta be willing to lose whatever ur putting in. Not to mention, Taking out a loan of any size to put into the market is the stupidest thing you can do. He fucked up in every way imaginable. I have no sympathy for him. He also held for like a day, so idk what to even say to that
Man is punching the air hard as fuck
He can open an another one
I took at 20k loan and I’m up 15k but I started bbby around $5 and I also have a 20k stake in GME, I either go broke or go home rich, please don’t be like me, I could have lost it all.
Pussies must’ve had $20 limit sell orders
Yup, bunch of fucking regards
100%
In a way that's a good thing.  That's probably most of the remaining paper hands.  I'm going to put another 1k in.  We have to keep the pressure up.  We have all the momentum and the hedges are probably throwing everything they have at us right now.  One more giant buy push today and tomorrow and it's over.  The plebs will jump in and before you know it Kenny G will be giving you a blowie behind the Wendy's dumpster
I thought it was stocks and calls? Isn’t a gamma squeeze happening?
I saw it hesitate at $16 and set a 20 limit to entice the hedgies. Rolled back over. In 30 min hundreds of stock are sold and I woke up in a flash

Don’t worry boys threw it in options for the day leverage it to the tits
Wtf…you mean for once I was able to buy a stock at a low enough price and it’s actually going green and not red?!?

What kind of sorcery…
Dude Im swimming in fking $$$ if I sell now. But I wont, I aint no paper handed bitch.
I think some of these apes are confusing BBBY with BBY because best buy is also going up haha.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
At least BBY puts are cheaper haha
[removed]
Grabs the popcorn...
What kinda pussy sells at 20$ 😂😂😂😂
Not the bagholders for sure
The kind without a lambo that’s for sure. I don’t have one either, but this pussy certainly doesnt
F in the chat for ppl who sold this morning 

F in the chat for ppl who sold yesterday

F in the chat for ppl who sold Friday

and so on and so forth...
F in the chat for people who will sell tomorrow
Paper hands never succeed
Sold last week for a loss, bought back in this morning for a net gain of like 50% so far. F for everyone we’ve left behind 🫡
lol dang

WSB having a megathread on a stock is BULLISH
Brings me back 😭😭
My biggest mistake was trying to make sense of BBBY.

Turns out I just need to turn off brain, buy and watch.
You just need to stay dumb
Just what I did today
Just what I did today
Why sell at $22 when you can sell at $100
We’re breaking 20 today, easy!!
$22
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
$25
My only regret. Not buying more…
I can relate.
Easy solution. Buy more.
If you have the money there's till place for you fellow ape
Don’t paper hands this shit. We are ending the day over 20
Dude we’re hitting 23 at least
IF YOU SELL NOW YOURE A DISGRACE! HODL!!

Alright fucktards I'm in.  I sold Palantir for 1000 shares of BBBY.  I bought at $8 and at $19.  Am I doing this right?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Just got kicked out from wholefoods by security for inappropriately touching organic watermelons
Finally some quality shitposting
Was there penetration?
Wee wee no work, only touching
Took out my line of credit and dumped it into bbby , good luck me

Edit at 10:21 est: thank you u beautiful orangutans for the gainsssss
solid retard move, I approve of!!
LOL people who sold at 17.90 imagine being a pussy before it hits 18
Thank you whoever sold at $15.75 this morning so I could buy a few more lol. Walnut.
Imagine selling
Personally, i like it alot more when the number goes up, rather than when the number goes down
I feel the same way personally…………………
I agree up chart much prettier than down chart
I have to say, it's a bold opinion. But I share it quite strongly
Fucking sicko
IM ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY FOR ONCE
Well I bought 40 dollar calls expiring Friday.  Save some crayons for me
how much did you pay and how many contracts you got?
I paid .39 premium and got 4 of em cuz I am a scared biotch but now they have trippled since then so I wish I had bet more.
rationally speaking this sounds way too expensive for like a quadrouple of the price. But I now fully believe they will be covered, good luck to you! 
By the way ( I am a dumb retard ), when the price hits $50, you made $40k, right?
Bro I'm retarded too.  If anything more retarded than you.  So idk what it'd be worth.  It would depend on what day it hits 50 and what the stock volume is.  I would like to have 40k tho.  That would be nice.
just bought 150 shares let’s go
I just called in sick
Yall bout to figure out what the beyond in bbby stands for
It’s special universal remotes right?
Remember the higher this goes the bigger the swings it’s gonna have, in short don’t panic
Watched it go to $8, didn’t buy… watched it go to $16, didn’t buy… I’m in, better late than never
Lmao same. Fml
same buddy FOMO 4lyfe
me too bro time to make bank
I only have 20 shares it's not much, but it's honest work 🥺
[removed]
Thats a lot of tendies
I bought 5k this morning

Bought another 3k after the first dip

Just pumped another 4k in during this dip

I’m doing my part LETS FUCKING GO
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Great choice 👍
I put in another 4k during this most recent dip.

Currently up 20k
If $25 by EOD I’m taking the wife to bed bath and beyond and letting her pick out any 25 items she wants !
Just let her pick out $25 worth of items, you’re going overboard
Or just invest the money in BBBY
remember the guy with the 27k loan lol
I almost feel bad for him![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I think about him often
what was his initial buy $10? and sold at $8?
yeah, he bought at around $10 and his stop loss triggered at 12.5% (about $9)
Man, just imagine being the first black guy to go to college in your family, then you start up Loop Capital and become wealthy and then you get taken out by a an almost bankrupt place that sells towels.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Who else is “working” rn
Remote baby
I am 😳😬
It took me all morning just to log in haha.
I had to stop and take a walk around the block lol
Of course they halted again fuck it I’m going all in 50k
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
The halts always kill momentum. Fuck the market.
Today I became the boyfriend
the 27k loan guy punching the air rn
Guy is major sad rn
😆
35shares at 16.70$ ain't much but it's honest work
third worlder reporting in with 17 shares at 11.40$, if it flies the car upgrade will be around the corner.
You’re both in a better place than me. I had $43 to spare, so I bought 2.74 shares at $15.67. I won’t accumulate any wealth, but hope to walk away with more gambling money than I had before.
How does 36% profit feel like you fucker
i've put all my money i had on this
Enjoy the ride broski
7 @ $15
For those who are selling early: I get it, you need money, but keep in mind that the whole catalyst for a squeeze is when short sellers try to close their positions and there are no shares left to buy back because of HODL.
Ahh just as I suspected, mid day short Hedgefuck dump incoming. What a feeble attempt to shake us off

Suck my balls you quant fucks, we’ve done this song and face before!

WE AINT SELLING SHIEEEETTTT!!
Smart people are taking profit. Doubling your money in a few days is nice.
Don’t sell. This is a circuit breaker because the action is quicker than the market can keep up with
[removed]
Damn, I was thinking that was high. I’m just buying now![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
$420.69 is not a meme
NOT SELLING UNTIL TRIPLE DIGITS LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
For those who don’t know; halting is automatic. If it drops or raises 10 percent in a certain time, it halts automatically. Nothing to worry about here
Yep, but we are seeing halts where the put options are. The shorts are being destroyed, drops happen, then we all keep piling in and it will continue up to past 50 before the end of the week!
I saw BBBY go up to $8 and didn't buy. everyone call me a retard
Regard
Same, but I just bought at $18.50.
Retard!
I didn’t buy @5
Don’t forget to upvote the thread
[deleted]
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
depends on number of shares
What are you waiting for? Buy before it hits 20
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
i just wanna watch it creep to 20 then 30 then 40 and beyond without stopping it would be so cool if it worked like that
The good news is it's only gotta hit $3381 a share for me to get back what I lost last year.

Exit: didn't mean to delete
It might
I just sold everything and bought BBBY
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
I did as well, I hope it will turn out to be a smart move for the both of us.
Haha, me tooooooooo! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
$80 EOW?
80$ EOW and I might consider buying 420$c jan23
It’s looking like it’ll hit it before the end of today
volume hit 80mil in the first hour. wowie zowie!
Squeeze type volume
My $7 cost basis makes me feel like a god. To those of you rocking $4 and $6 shares - Godspeed you fucking regards 🫡🫡
I'm over here feeling good at 11.62 haha
Checking in with a 4.80 average... yeah, it feels nice. The only regret is not buying more...
Feel really bad for the 27K loan guy
Someone needs to check if he's still alive.
What happened to him?
He limited his downside risk and his upside risk. It happens sometimes. That's why true YOLO-ers never set a stop loss
I just FOMO’d in for 150 shares at $22.88. It was mortgage money for the month so let’s hope for the best lmao
Free money
The balls on this guy
Well I mean I can’t call you smart nor stupid my only response is ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Godspeed
HOLD u stupid fuks we're going to 30 today
Damn and I thought 15.48 was an absutely retarded price but I look like a genius at work
Same at 15.5 lmao
Those 🌈🐻trying hard asf to stop our gain train
this is a sad day for watermelons
Fuck it. Just yolo’ed $20,000 from a LOC lol. Let’s go.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I wish i had that kind of money to gamble, good luck and fuck you in advance
I don’t, hence the line of credit lol. Gamblers be gambling
I am going to take a shit and shower. I better see $21 when I get back.
Gonna skip right to 22
Guys chill.  A stock that can go up 25% in an hour is going places.  Don't be scared by a small drop
Many thanks for you calming words bröther
most people waiting for a small drop to buy in
RIP SPCE...
That dude who took a 27k loan out and yolod it has to be SICK right now 😂😂
Guy went full retard but still had enough normie in him to set a stop loss. If he just full sent his retardation he’s be making bank rn
He will be back
No regrets now, right? 👍
lets get to$30 by lunch time 😤😩😤💎✋🏼💎✋🏼💎
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
just remember you could've bought at 15 yesterday ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Don’t remind me. I was waiting for the morning dip this morning that never showed up!
And could’ve bought at 22 today
Anyone else meant to be doing their day job? Fuck this is wild
lol fuck my real job, this is where the dopamine's at
Haven’t worked yet today
I did a bunch of work yesterday so this is my job for today XD
I’m up more than I make in a month so fuck that job
# if u sell bbby you have smol pp
thank you Confucius
Ok boys I gtg back to work, I set the price alert at $80 so I guess I'll be back in 30 min?
Millionaire by lunch
So we've gone from diamond handed apes to the melon molesters in 18 months. GG EZ wsb.
Remember they did this with $GME and then it hit $400. Patience friends.
You're fucking in it now!!
We are almost halfway to a guy pissing on his bosses desk
Better not pussy out
Do it for him <3
Legit hope all of you are making life changing money.  Cheers!
Not so much life changing but I can now go get my car fixed
I am very happy to hear that.  I made some small gains myself and couldn't be happier!
If I'm able to buy my second house with this stock increase money, I'll tattoo BBBY's logo on me.
We are, thank you!
Friendly reminder that if we get to $20, some guy will fuck a watermelon while another guy will eat said watermelon
I'm ready for it
We got there
And one guy will convert the watermelon into piss and pee on the boss's desk.
I literally opened my broker account last week to start investing in ETFs and now I’m all in bbby with my savings ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
this is the way
wise move
thats the way!
ANYTHING <$80 = EARLY
Really think we need to raise this
Absolutely correct
HKD started multiplying at exponential rate. The meme game has come so way, huge global awareness. This is going to pump for a while minimum 5x from here.
Can you imagine what would happen if DFV posted a portfolio update with BBBY?
I am wishing for this since a few days as well, the state of the sub would be RETARDED AS FUCK.
LMAO that would be fucking INCREDIBLE
If we hit 30 I’ll give my dog a boop on the nose
I wish I could pin basic market educations in these threads.

Yo fuckwits - volatility halts are automatic and based on rapid price changes either up or down. They're not a grand conspiracy of Those-Who-Own-Your-Ass. 

You've had two on BBBY. Usually the second one is a decent time to enter the position if you've been fence sitting.
I seriously have bought at the base of each dip every time it’s dipped boys.

Up over 20k

This shit is life changing

AND I AINT SELLING YET
Wow $30 EOD, $80 EOW guy is actually gonna be right.
Odds of it breaking 20 today?
Decent. When we make it over $20 thats when the real fireworks begin.
just crossed 21...
200? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
10000000%
Let’s fucking hope🚀🚀
too the moon my boy 🚀🚀🚀
Done and done
there was no way we weren't getting at least a little pull back here
market's been open for an hour and volume has exceeded shares outstanding *and* available float.
HOLD THE LINE!!!!
Buy the line*
LOVE ISNT ALWAYS ON TIME
Late to the party but im in with 49 shares at $17.18 god im such a fucking retard lets gooooooooooooo

Anyone remember last week when it was $9 and we got called bag holders LOL
I member
Lol the good ol days
OMG I MISSED THIS SINCE GME🚀🚀
This is still retail coming in. Still no sign of shorts covering.
Keep us posted ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
How can you tell the difference.
Buy the dip!! 🦍🦍🦍
Its an honor to witness THE squeeze of the year with you guys.
Love you guys!  I can finally give up my spot behind the Wendy's dumpster.  WooHoo!
The paper hands sold at $20. Get off the rocket if you can’t handle the ride. All aboard to $420.69!! 🚀🚀
I wanna see 27k loan guy fuck a 🍉🍉
STOP SELLING
Seriously.. get your bitchhands out of your assessment, and HODL... this stock could go triple digits if people weren't selling at $17-18.

*edit* assessment was supposed to say asses.. but.. assessment is growing on me..

Those are rookie numbers. You wanna pump those up
100s cool, but you know whats cooler? 1000

#We finally convinced the mods that we out number the BBBY "bots"

#All it took were solid, consistent, memes

1 min of silence for each paperhand who sold under 20$
HOLY SHIT. Some guy is going to have to fuck a watermelon.
THE WATERMELON COMETH
$30 EOW? Fuck outta here, EOD 🚀🚀🚀

In AH🙂
Look At both BBY and BBBY graphs. They’re almost identical. Some people definitely buying the wrong stock lol
HALTS DON’T SCARE US. HOLD YOUR TOWELS TIGHT
lol
stop worrying rocket just refueling
This is some of y’all’s first rodeo, isn’t it?

“Limit up” halts typically cause sell off from the point they stop at.

Edit: I should add the fall isn’t necessarily permanent, just a sharp sell off immediately after a limit up.
LFG
A break of 30 and we could see something special
Guys, remember the long game. We have over 20,000 20C expiring this Friday. If it stays over 20 bucks (which seems very possible), the shorts will have to hedge their positions. Remember the long game
THIS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I'm stupid does this mean hold or sell?
It means hold, because if it says over 20 bucks by the end of the day Friday, the hedgies will have to buy shares next week to cover their short positions. Textbook gamma squeeze. All today is, is a quick boost for the gamma squeeze
Bought in at $26 back in April. Y'all came back for me 😭
ape together strong
nice, but y u do that?
That's when Ryan Cohen first mentioned it. Or at least, the first I saw of him mentioning it.

I made a lot off of GME (and still am) so I figured I'd roll with his calls. May not have been stupid after all.
Sold my BBBY yesterday at 60% profit (cost basis 10, cash out 16) feeling like an absolute chad.  


Paper handed bitch is more like it, congrats to all you true kings out there!
At least you were honest. Profit is profit
I should have bought the fucking calls instead of the shares. Shits up like 700%
Say no more,  pulled out half on 21 avarage, got in at 10..
100 shares @ 12.78, i aint fuckin leaving
400 @ 12.39, lets do this
Bought $10 jan23 calls when we were under $5 a share. 💲💲💲💲💲
Pulled the trigger on 100 shares @ 18.46 this morning just for the lulz
Ok I swear 65 by eow I walk into work with pie straight to my boss face I flim it and post. I'm in 100 shares here we go
!remindme 5 days
27k loan guy holding a few calls could easily be cashing out 100k right now lmao RIP
Just went all in with 10k!!!!!!!!!
Proof
#BBBY going to 100K
$50 EOD IS NOT A MEME
Would be sick if it went to 69
LOOK AT ME. I AM THE HEDGE FUND NOW.
Hold the line boys, dips are fine so people snatch up the paper hands
quick rest stop before $50
DONT SELL ITS A BEAR TRAP WE ARE GOING TO $100
Careful. We dont know where it’s going. Make your money and know when to leave.
Do you work for Melvin capital
Are you in a cult
Buy the dip, don’t be discouraged we all remember this with GME hold the fucking line
This is were it went wrong with GME. Stay strong apes
Yep, start selling now and you will not get to 50 or 100 ever! Stay in it. They are fighting!
Together Ape Strong 🦍🦧
Just put 20k in who cares let’s ride
i love you
everytime I stop watching the price to play with my dog the price goes up a shot ton, so I'll see you all in a couple hours
Thank you for your service
good doggy
I’m not even gonna use the 20% off coupon when I shop there anymore
this guy fucks
This shit is more exciting then any sports event or concert I’ve ever been too lol
Seriously
And I only bought like 8 shares lol.
Lolol I wish I had a cheerleader outfit with bbby across the top
BUY
How sick do you think 27k loan guy is feeling right now that he bought high and sold low?
that was a community lesson. 

Ignore at your own expense.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Rip
Ok I know we have all heard this frequently……..but this really could run and take the same kind of spirit as gme. $35 really doesn’t seem out of reach at all with ape power
If it hits $35 it could easily gamma ramp over $50+ and have a series of halts. I remember watching DWAC run like 800% in a day like that lol
I stg I will literally wake up at 6:00 am like usual and go to work as usual if bbby hits $35. Kinda wish I bought more though ahhh
You allowed to buy more😉
You already know I bought more this morning LOL
Hehe! Ofc I do! Good job😉😃😃😎
What rhymes with margin call
Garglin balls
Money!
Booty call???
Just bought in at 19.64. Here comes the plummet
you bought at a res/sup line. don't you dare bitch out.
All in at an avg of $7.95 and I’m not even remotely tempted to sell. See you at $100/share
5.5 avg here with 55 shares, not doing shit until 100/share. This looks way too similar to GME at jan 21, might hold half my shares for 300-400/share
I have 300 shares. So, If that happens…I’ll make 6 figures….I only make around 50k a year so that would be a life changer
#Press F to pay respects to the peons who sold at a loss because they thought they were bagholding

F
I am not ashamed of being a retard. Or a peon.
That was me a couple weeks ago at 3. Then I bought more. Making back all my loss and was a BBBY employee of 2 years. Revenge tour
All my savings are in this @ 15
25 EOD easy.
We like the stock
This group has yet again saved a single mom from the edge of OF.  My dignity and child thank you.
I have a 100@$10.98. I’m contemplating putting my car money into this. Please pray for my ‘08 Saturn Astra with 155k miles to live a little longer.
$30 EOD?
yep
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Bad month to be a watermelon
BBBY was at $30 this year, $30 is just the first step in the squeeze
I physically cannot look away from the ticker
This is real ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
There are 350,000 call contracts on this. I have never seen that in my life.
Let’s put them all ITM!!
Taking profit is worthless, just hold.  We're only losing time at 22-23$. Hold
Told old ass wife to go out and have a good time shopping with her boyfriend. Afterwards go have dinner and fuck his brain out. Don’t bother coming home anymore because her shit is on the grass.

I’ll be fine by myself. Checking out color lambo and getting a young girlfriend. Sleep good tonight in my new pillow that I picked up at BBBY.
Keep it f*cking going y’all!!!! Let’s hit $30!!!!!!!
80 EOW
I'm up +500% I'm still not selling 💎🙌🙌💎
WTF its stop at 28.04 at my screen
It’s been halted
Halted I think
Halted. I was watching too.
Halted for crazy volatility. Happens and is normal
Halted.
DO NOT SELL APES THIS IS NOT A DRILL DO NOT SELL IF WE HOLD WE CONTINUE GOING UP  


EVERYONE IS FOMOING ALL OVER THE WORLD
That 2 milly guy gonna be richer than Bill Gates by tomorrow
For real hahah
Just a friendly reminder that selloffs are normal and expected
Buy the dip you fucking retards. Let’s make these shorts commit sepukku
Stop turning shit companies into your roulette wheel and I’ll stop naked shorting.
Try sepukku
Don’t sell, pump it
They’re pulling the same BS they did with GME
This time we go to 100 tho!
Wow that was so exciting, watching my options climb in $1 increments with each passing second. Better than cocaine boys!
PIPI hard?
That dragon you will chase forever my buddy
what is this sketchy shit? BBBY and GME swapping halts then getting torpedoed after halt ends?
its automatic if the price drops or rises too fast
I get that, but the timing of the two and the way the price plummets as soon as the halt ends.
They are halting us.. Let's buy buy buy..... This is WSB!!! ( 300 voice )
We’ve still got an $80 target to hit, a halt at $23 isn’t going to do shit
Some of those who shorted BBBY are being margin called and having their positions closed, which is forcing them to close some of the GME short positions too (likely short both stocks).
I did not buy the 10% dip that happened over the course of 10 minutes and I'm sad
We gonna blow past 30 today
I bought my first shares today at $16 thinking I missed out. Best decision I ever could have made.   


Remember Apes, its not too late. There is still fuel in this rocket!
Same here!
i bought in at 10 thinking i missed the boat when it was 8, reupped at 16 this morning
This is the way.
me when bbby goes down $5 in 10 seconds : fuck i shoulda sold

me when bbby goes back up $5 in 10 seconds : I'll sell when it goes up another 100
im this close to just dumping the rest of my portfolio into BBBY
Heard you wouldn't.
I did. The 2% loss on other shit is getting made up from this stock
You’ll regret if you don’t lol
Literally same
do it DO IT

You can do both btw.
And the squeeze hasn’t even begun😂😂
Anyone else see it touch $18 briefly

Edit: it shot through that $18 roof like the Wonkavator while I was typing this
I wasn’t smart enough to buy gme when it rallied and got squeezed, but y’all helped me see the light. Now I’m a little less regarded.
90.2 shares avg @14.94
Happy days!

Bought 40 shares worth - its the best I can do while still playing the GME long game.

I trust you all to be right about this...
Buy all BBBY and then put it in GME after we moon
How about you put deez nuts in yo mouth 😉
Just put in another 1000$

Lol that's me to a fucking T. Do we have twin dongs? To the moon!!!
If I make 100k out of BBBY im buying myself a new set of bedding and towels.
Bbbbbbbby is the sound I’ll make motorboating some strippers ass cheeks this weekend.
Right as she claps her cheeks on your neck, taking precious oxygen. Jokes on her tho, you need a brain in order to be brain dead
BBBY is going EXACTLY how GME did in Jan 2021
If this hits 300 I’ll fucking loose it
Don't stop I'm almost there
yeah for frealreal
that one dude who could have made like 40k but now owes 3k
Genuinely he is a true retard, was obvious what this would do

#MY FUCKING CALL IS UP 600%
I look away for 5min and we jump from 22 to 28. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
THEY HALTED US CUZ THE SUITS ARE SCARED
GME always did this when it halted. Hold the line.
HOLD AND BUY THE DIP, WE HAD TONS OF DIPS WITH GME!!!
still a long way to go to $65 for that guy to piss on his bosses desk. bought some more to this gofundme goal
Guess what this reminds me of. GME
More like AMC
I wouldnt know only ever bought GME. Though it is true that until this breaks $100 it isnt even licking GME's toes
Another fucking halt?! 
We PUMP Harder!

#ExpectUs
It’s not dipping. It’s sliding down the slope to launch into space hold
Fuck bro you might be right. we going up
$28 is not the top! Keep buying.
169 is the top!
GME vets aren't sweating at all lmao I love this shit
Traded the stagnant period, now holding for the riiiip. LFG!! GME 2.0
Hell yea 😹😹📸
Yep. Not gonna say it’s easy mode, but it definitely helps having been through the halt bs before. I don’t have a ton of shares, but excited to see where this goes!
We have to get this to 60 so the guy pisses on his boss desk
Beyond 80 is where the beds are
I removed my sell button
🍑🤡😎🤣

45 eod easy

How not-retarded do you think I am?

Uh, please don't be regarded enough to stop loss this bitch. It will flash dump and leave you behind with your couple of bucks extra.
You will always ahve a home here
I bought 120 shares just now trying to get a down payment for a house to be retarded in.
If it doesn’t go well I will need you to move into my place and pay me some rent. 
I have a pool but would need to charge you a $5 cover fee before you could swim.
now this man has a new house
Already enough for another months mortgage payment. Let’s get this bitch paid off.

Dan - It’s hard to buy something you hate and it’s hard to sell something you love. 

When the party is over you have to sign for the check
Now that you have that out of your system DIAMOND HAND🚀💎🙌
Lol you still hold GME? 🤣
Sure do.  In fact I am taking BBBY gains once this is done and buying more.  DRS is over half of the float and my cost average is in the green :)
When is BBBY done do you know? It will be done like GME is done? 😆
Remember this is a marathon not a sprint
This shit can easily reach triple digits.

I said fuck it, I wanna be apart of the stupidity, so I bought a 35 call for Friday, lemme dream dammit
Good
Just yolo’d 2900 shrs @ $16.53. Total position 3,778 @ $15.41. WTF?!?!  Keep buying Apes!! Don’t want to look back at all the tendies you would have had if you got in at $20/shr. At some point 29 million  short shares will have to be covered and the price will skyrocket….to the moooooooon!!!!!
No price targets, only up! 🚀
Bought $500 more at $19.56
 BBBY to 25. All these paper hands sold at 20 but the dips only means we can buy more
25…today. Should be at 40 by Friday

I also read this when it came out. Pure fools! :)
they're trying to "control the narrative". They are failing.
They’re desperate for us to stop. Shaking the trees for the paper hands to fall out.
They said the same crap with GME, no new play book here. They want to scare off the mob investors and us in specific!!! Diamond hands bitches!!! 💎💎💎💠💠💠

damn I wonder how the $27k loan guy is doing right now, he could have doubled up and instead sold for a loss.
Short sellers won't be sweating until 25. That's when they started shorting the stock a few months ago
Bbby gap up every 5 dollars after options go itm. Next leg up is 25. Watch for it to rest at 24.5 to see the next punch to 30.
Today would be nice!
Already ther
Yes NICE !!
Holding until $25 >!000 000!<
Pump it up, $18 for a share is nothing if it gets to three digits
I’m dumping another $5k in if we hit $20 strong
Go time then
Ayo
23 and climbing!
Bought $5k worth at 20.06
Nice! I only have 74 shares at 8.56 but I’m still feeling great haha
Laughs in cost basis of 5.20!
If you sold for minor gains I feel bad for you son.

We’re at 21 dollars and this shit ain’t done.
I’m up over a grand today. Bought in at $7. I’m hard.
I'm up 3000 it feels good fellow ape
Fuck yeah it does. This one rally is negating all of last years losses. Currently only -25.8%, was 35% yesterday. This is the stock market I like lol.

I just gotta say, it’s nice to be back in here with y’all boys
This will continue to happen as long as they keep going short beyond float
BBBY to $30 before the end of the week?
EOD
By tomorrow 2pm at the latest.
At this rate, you might see it touch $30 eod.
this is only the bed and bath, the beyond isnt even here yet
GET OFF THIS THREAD AND BUY BBBY
If this shit hits $30 today I'll start using real towels as cum rags, purchased exclusively at BBBY.

$27 oh my golly wolly
yes

yes 

and yes
I don’t know what to do. I’ve never seen gains this huge. When do I sell my options? What do I do with my hands?

EDIT: I’m not kidding, like I’m kind of just walking in circles with my phone right now. I’ve been investing in stocks for two years at least. Somebody call my mother
masturbate
OK, what about the other hand?
I’m also wondering the same
HMU if you figure out the answer
relax. It's just begun
Sell your options and double down on actual shares
If you’re at a point that you can sell one or two calls and cover your initial investment and be comfortable with the number of calls you have left, do it.
Major resistance at 23,5-24. We are going to make that, stay strong apes 💪🏻 💎
Megathread is back.

This is so beautiful.. BACK TO THE GLORY DAYS!!!!!
bruh we need to keep this going I'm making twice as much as the day before for the past three days. this shits insane

This is exactly like GME. This is just the beginning
FIDELITY JUST HALTED MY TRADING OF BBBY!!!!!!!!!!!!
$100 is not a meme!
The 30min candle is just green dildos. Amazing.
Just dumped a solid grand into bbby, let’s go brothers! 🚀🚀🚀
If this hits 30 I’m going to go to my bed bath beyond store and scream at the top of my lungs
Get ready in 15 minutes
I got one around the corner from my house I may go there to buy some shit and support
lol here was me thinking this was just another hype train, god speed boys (no positions)
Get in bro! There's still time! This is just the beginning
I nutted back at $21. Don’t think I can go again at 25.
Again 😩 💦
You bastards made me fomo into some calls....thank you
That guy that took out a 27k loan and lost 4k prob bout to end it all
2 years ago I never thought I'd be heavily breathing while looking at a stock line. This is nuts. Fucking nuts.
We are halted don’t panic it’s to upside
They’ve halted us! Take them for all they have! $BBBY 30EOD!
Did they just halt the stock at $28.04?

Money printer is fixed
BUY THE DIP
It was a circuit breaker
Haulted again. Get ready to spam that fucking buy button.
Dip good enough to buy?
Always
yes
Wait till 22 I think
Yes
$25 will feel cheap when it’s 30 again
They taking turns halting BBBY and GME.  Sure ain’t rigged 😂😂
Halted… this is so corrupt
What broker?
It automatically does that based off percentage movements in a short time frame.
20% coupon activated limited time offer
Hahahahaha super under appreciated joke
This is classic before the bigger run!  So excited for this!!!! 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
53% borrow fee lmfao
100 eow is kinda not a meme anymore
EOD my friend
Buy the dip!!!!
Did we get halted on the down?

Yes
YES

2 halts in 10 minutes. One up, one down
Expect many halts today.
Has anyone done a wellness check on the bloke who took out 27k and sold at a loss? 😳
we should send him a watermelon gift basket to help him cope
It is so satisfying knowing there are some funds probably getting absolutely starched right now. How long before some rich vulture goes on MSNBC and talks about how them getting ass fucked is so bad for the average middle class because volatility is scary.
KEEP THE BUY PRESSURE UP, WE ARE JUST TAKING OFF
ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITIES ARE HERE… KEEP PUSHING
That halt actually caused a healthy pullback! Lmao Run BBBY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Perfect for those on the side to get in
Realistically this is going to at least $30 so I don't see why anyone would sell.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I’m feeling 35-40 EOD
POWER HOUR IS COMING SOON, VOLUME ABOUT TO HIT 200MIL
It’s not even 12 lmfao
We want 30!
Man I want 550!
Fuck 30, let’s go 60 EOW!!!
My favourite part is when the little green squiggly line goes up
Mine too
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I should have dumped my entire portfolio into this bad boy
We haven't even reached $420, do it!
BBBY FUCKS!!! 🚀 

I’m up 300% on my calls
**ah, remember when the stock fell from 12 -> $8 and all those paper hands sold...**
bet they regret that a lot now 😂
Literally mad my 3 months of working paycheck in a matter of a day
i just woke up 

what the fuck

i love u guys
Hardest morning wood
+128%

IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING
Remember, if we hit $45 - all options are ITM. 25 million share swing. Big moves after that.
This shit saving my account is hilarious
get out of jail free card
I can’t believe I almost took profits yesterday in the 14s
huge sell wall at 28, keep on buying
My favorite thing about BBBY is that they don't just stop at bed and bath supplies. They go above and beyond material possessions and really offer a glimpse at the true nature of reality.
#TIME TO FUCK!
**PSA TO ALL NEWBIES:**

1. “Limit up” halt typically causes sell off quickly after trading resumes.

2. “Limit down” halt can go either way, but early stages of a squeeze means it’s more likely to go up after trading resumes. This is not always the case though… I remember seeing 2 or 3 limit downs in a row during $GME squeeze. Much tougher to trade.

3. Life comes at you fast, but the squeeze comes at you faster. Once $GME really kicked off, it only lasted a few trading days and then huge sell off happened. Figure out what price you’re happy selling at, and stick to it! Don’t let some fucker on here tell you how to trade it. It’s your money, you decide what to do with it.

**Now let’s make some fucking money!**
Took a second 27k loan bought at 17.70 gonna sell at 8$ again LFG
I just bought in at 16 let’s go!
I bought in at 13$
THE APES ARE BANGING ON THE DOOR OF $20
Just saw an article in Robinhoods news thing saying that this stock took a step back because of unrealistic valuations. Someone is scared and that’s enough for me to yolo. I’m in baby
I wish I would have had the balls to put 30 k into this instead of 1.2k. It’s gone up 54% since I bought in. I’m such a pussy.
You put $1200 into a meme stock?  You're not pussy.  You're retarded!  Well played sir.  Well played.
What’s worse a pussy or a retard 

I have made 900. I could have made 15,000 :( I’m trying to rebuilt a year of losses.
Unless you suddenly go psychic on us, it's just luck.  I jumped into BB, Wish, Clov... who even can remember all the shit moves I made.  But THIS time for sure!  Right?
I was dumb with wish too. Bought at $13 🤪 not selling doge was my biggest mistake amongst many.
Well fuck me now I wish I bought more this morning. Jesus.
I put £500 in. You still might lose it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
460 @ $16.71. I’m officially in.
Nice
BRACE FOR THE TAKE OFF !

To the Moon & Beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
LFG RIP 27k LOAN GUY LMAOOOO ONE OF US
For real, he would have doubled his money soon... Feel bad for him, but man what a fucking retard haha.

Bought 49 shares at $15.70. Is it weird to have a boner at work?
Weird not to imho
It’d definitely be weirder if I didn’t
where do you work?
In an office
Definitely a valid question
Just hit $18 already! It’s inevitable
Hey I’m sugar mamma looking for a loyal honest and trustworthy sugar baby, that can put smile on my face. I spoil the baby with my money, I don’t really need sex or nudes from you, I just need someone to talk to when I’m bored and I will pay $3000 as first payment and $5000 as weekly allowance say yes if you’re interested
Da fuq
Message me up

Thinking about that 27K loan guy and how he sold out within 2 days

Paper hands are shit... He would have made some much profit by now.

Switched from calls to shares.

[deleted]
Welcome back. Hold this time

If we don’t get a disabled buy button it’s going on be even grater
Added 1000 shares.
Your cock must be huge
Bring out the watermelon! 🍉
Keeps tickling $20
100M volume in 90 minutes. **Those are rookie numbers. Pump that shit up!**
Wonder what the 27k loan guy is thinking now
I'm so retarded I saw it hit $20.30 and though 'halfway to $21' like a dollar has 60 cents just like a clock.

So...3dte calls?
Fuck it, dumped my Google, threw it into BBBY. LETS FUCKING GO
Google don’t even sell towels, useless stock
Yeah and I got a six pack from buy buy baby just in case
$25 EOD IS NOT A MEME
Never was. Like the 80 eow
OH MY GOD

I'm beginning to believe
I haven’t been this stoked for something since the early GME hype. Let’s fucking go! 🚀🌕
Agreed!!!
We're parabolic BBBY! 🚀
How embarrassed would you be right now if you were one of the people calling us bagholders last week?

Missed out on $GME, because of a hospital stay. Now I‘m ready for $BBBY 🚀

This statement is hilariously insane no matter when you read it.
$30 EOD 👀👀👀
And then I jizzed in my pants
Why aren’t you degenerates at your 9-5
We are, we work remotely 😂😂😂
We don’t have those, but I’ll take a couple puts one one
I am just not working cause BBBY is paying me more
I work the Wendy’s dumpster after the market closes
Which hedge fund is going to close down to bankruptcy this time around?
60 or I'm not even excited
My only regret is not buying more calls
Same, and another regret is not yoloing with my roth ira while i was at it lol
I cant stop buying...
I bought at $9.00 and sold at 10.50... I'm the biggest fuckin idiot on WSB. Smh I'll wave goodbye well you guys are on the moon

Imagine being the idiot who sells at $25
This shit is gonna skyrocket once the halt ends
I’m going to throw up
Same
Me too.
Same
ITS NOT HALTED ON ROBINHOOD WE CAN STILL BUY
I was not on Robinhood assuming they would be the first to pull shady shit, are you kidding me
They learned from their mistakes apparently
Oh shit, HOLD THA LINE. Don’t back down, we will stand on the other side of the HALT stronger.
KEEP LOADING THIS BABY WITH AMMO
Halts aren’t bad! Just means this thing is going to the moon!
circuit breaker?
Yup
WE DID IT
Looks like they halted trading! We got'em on the run boys.
annihilate the yuppy scums!
They're just preparing to add in the 3rd number to the ticker
Hold or buy…..$28 is NOT the squeeze
BUY BUY BUY
THEY STOPPED GME TOO
Halted trading and manipulate trying to make us sell, over a little price drop
Lol the halt worked the way they wanted
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Cathie's mistake was not making ARKBBBY

Yahoo! Finance and Bloomberg are ignoring us, lol
#IF YOU WEREN'T AROUND FOR THE GME SNEEZE THIS IS WHAT IT FELT LIKE 💎👐🦍🚀

we touching 30 before lunch is over.
DONT SELL WHEN IT DIPS YOU FUCKS
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)

They literally forcing price to go down that’s bullshit!!!
Ain't no apes smart enough to sell. 

WE HOLD
I remember when gme would halt and shave off a few bucks. Keep holding apes
It’s easy. Set an alert for $100 and close the app. Makes it easy to hold
true
Lol halted from going up too fast and now halted for going down too fast. This really is Jan 2021 GME vibes
REMOVE STOP LOSSES
Don’t let those scum win!! Lets go!!!
Lmao, $70 price target is actually in play
As it states in the WSB bible:
“Before the Rip must come the Dip”
THIS IS OUR TIME, BOYS. GET SOME!!!!!
Yo, gals too! Everybody get the shit in here!
Use limit buys and sells to ensure the market orders don’t cause it to drop
Seriously read what halts are. Lucky it wasn't halted for the day
Don't fear the halt. It's mind games!
Why are these pussies scared of a bunch of gorillas?
Bought 100 more at 24.78. Idgaf to the moon
If there are actually people selling this bs halt dumps…you don’t deserve to have money.
There hasn’t been a better good morning than to see 28.
Ok mfers the short interest is fucking massive right now, 55% of float and if we assume a bunch of us are diamond hands ..... 🚀 🌚
BBBY $300?? Possible?
EOD
If u can squeeze your balls for that long, yee sure!
Shorts got murked today
FOMO doubled my position this morning at $16.
ON ITS WAY TO $100, BUY NOW OR REGRET LATER
BUY THIS DIP OR REGRET IT FOREVER
Chin up, don't fall for scare tactics, haha.
EVERY REDDITOR AND TWITTER LAND LITERALLY HAS THIS STOCK

Who wants to see them
Which hedge fund are we bankrupting this time?
all of them
This next month I’m going to be GREEDY! Not taking out profits or settling for 200% gains. I will not settle for less than 1000% gains!!!

Bro samesies
I feel like I've had a religious experience today. I've seen the face of God.
Wish I was a fly on the wall at a fund that’s heavily shorting BBBY. Would love to see them reacting to this shit in real time
I'm mad cause the $25 CC I sold end of last week is ITM now at 3x profits when this could still run. Can't imagine how they are feeling for losing lmao
We're gonna be at 50 by the end of the week
We might open at $50 tomorrow lol

I contemplated buying at 4$, didn't. Tried to buy in at 10$ last Wednesday and couldn't. Ended up Yolo'ing at 14$ a couple days ago. True WSB retard move, but profiting :D  


Ya boy is up 3k-> 12K from this play just today, and I don't plan on selling either. LFG
How do you spot the $4 hype buys on here! So much noise who the fuck knows what's worth buying
It was like the around the time right before the second quarter GDP results were gonna be released. and I was like, welp, we're in a recession, 2 quarters of consecutive negative GDP. gonna wait for news to be released, then buy. Then they changed the definition and was like damn, now what. When you look at it. It'll just straight up look like the a bouncy ball hitting the floor. Sometimes you get fucked tho, and it just keeps going down. but not this case lol.

edit: there was no hype on here tbh. but bbby and gme were tied together a long time ago because of ryan cohen.

That’s how i felt when I sold ETH at 1100 before going to 2k
Dude me and a friend put $100 in that back in December 2020.  We sold after it ran to like 900.  We thought we did well with that $100.  Looking back we fucked up

Chad confirmed
I remember early July I got a 52 week low notification for BBBY. I thought, wait a second. Isn't that the stock Ryan bought $80 calls on?
"Probably nothing" I told myself as I bought $50 worth. 
I really wish I had had yoloed a couple extra zeros then!
When we hit 40 it should blast to 100 easy
All the DD I need.
Once we hit $20, it’s only up from there!

Hold boys and girls, this rocket is primed for take off.
Bout to hit +1000% on my calls. Told myself I’d sell there. Nope, I ain’t selling

Where’s loan dude at today? I want to know when he fomos back in so I can sell
LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME. I AM THE WARREN BUFFET NOW.

LOL imagine selling at 21 crazy innit
I got in at 21, is that to late?
Imagine having gotten in GME at $21
Can we reality expect it to go that high?
Only one way to find out.
#Imagine selling and staying poor like I did
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Lol
The REAL pressure point is $25. Before this, they were just adding to their short positions. But once it gets above 25, the hedgies risk eating into their OTHER profits. And they can't risk that. If we hit 25 and it sees support there, THEN we'll see the ACTUAL squeeze
I sold 1100 SNDL at major loss to buy BBBY @$19.76, will return.
Jesus lol
My broker wont even let me sell my sndl
SNDL was ass, I expected so much more
SNDL was ass, I expected so much more
It will recover eventually but not today. FML if Schumer gets shit done while I'm gambling.
If you buy bbby you have a very high iq like myself.
hello, fellow IntELleCtuaL
N me 2
I'm up 100% already today...beyond disbelief 

Thx bobby
The stock is going the same direction as my penis
Only up!
Doubled my position. This is GME 2.0
sigh. time to start watching bbby ticker all day like I did for GME. sorry work.
Just missed a client call because my retarded eyes are staring at this ticker
Literally anyone who thinks we can’t get to $100 or that they’re too late is actually stupider than dumb. GME went to $480
Bro the chances of this stock hitting $100 is kinda slim. Not impossible but slim. Don't be that guy who stays stuck in BBBY for years because he didn't pull out. If your profit is good enough to take a picture then it's good enough to sell.
Bought in last week on Wednesday at around $10. Thursday my first child was born, a beautiful boy. Been steadily increasing my position and just sold off half of my bullshit Acorns account I opened years ago to double down, riding this train for my boy.
Congratulations! Rename him Bobby
My best to your bboy
hero
I was crushing on this girl who was iffy on going on a date, now I'm balls deep in BBBY and gonna take 2 way hotter girls for chicken tendies when this week is done
Idk if I understand what’s happening and how this is possible
Sudden urge to consume watermelon
That watermelon just got tainted, bruh.
HOLD
Got in at $15.7 on open. I'm fucking holding!
Hell yeah
Fuck you im buying more.
BED BATH AND BUY BOYS!
How am I supposed to work right now
I'm feeling sick... \*cough cough\*
I almost feel obligated to go buy some towels from the store now. Haha.  


Lets get it!!
The squeeze is nigh!!!! HOLD and get your watermelons ready!!! EOD $30!!!
I’m thinking $42 EOD based on a trend line and this fucking insane volume
Fuck yes
The open interest on the 25c for this week is huge, if we hit that there is no top
Holy shit the volume
Why hasn't BBBY halted once, but GME always seems to halt?
It’s the slow drip drip drip 💧

my guess they trying to avoid doing what they did last time. they won't get away with it twice
GME is a Russel 1000 stock.
It's about how quickly it goes up not how much
cuz it isnt as big as GME was at Peak
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Because it has to move 10% in 5min to trigger a halt. GME has done that plenty of times. BBBY keeps coming close, but it’s been on a more steady surge than a violent and immediate gain of $2 in 5min
>Etoro has removed bbby from it's big movers.

I think only moves larger than 10% in 5 minutes cause halts
There’s rules man
Hey look, you got your halt! Lol 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I saw that!
I have so many unread emails from today piling up. I can't stop watching the ticker.
I will continue to beg,  we need the BBBY sea shanty!
Cohen has $60 and $80 calls. Nobody should be touching their shit until this blasts off even more
If we can break the $25 / $30 stop loss pussies, this will hit $40 EOD tomorrow.

Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze. 🦍🦍🦍
Holy shit this is just like
Gme
Next stop, $30. Get ready melon fucker, you're gonna have to add another one for a three-way.
I wonder if the other side of that melon is available. If bbby hits 50 i might be willing to eiffle tower with him
This is what happens when you insult BBBY Boucher's momma.
Lol
lol shorts are seriously fucked
To all those people asking if you're too late. 
You're never too late when the stock is going to hit 80$ 
You'll have smaller gains. So jump the fuck in . 
The rocket is taking off
two hours in and volume is over 150 million on 79 million shares outstanding. WTF!!!
APES TOGETHER MAKE STRONG -  BUY SHARES, NOT OPTIONS AND KEEP HODLING!

THEY ARE AFRAID OF US

Halted just means weve activated the bosters
I LITERALLT BOUGHT A 25$ CALL 10 MIN AGO WND IM UP 300$????? HOLLY FUCK
Circuit breaker? Trading halted!
Yup lol
We made someone trip on a wire
THEY HALTED, KEEP BUYING

“Am I too late buying in at 14$?”
Bought 14 shares at 14 and doubled up ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Halted!!!
Holy shit wtf is happening
halted with an Ask of $1500, Bid of $0.50. LOL
stay strong - just a lil halty halt
TRADING HALTED?!?!?!
You crazy motherfuckers actually did it. 

Sold most of my calls before the halt. Holding my 8 1/23 80c and bought 10 more with a portion of the profits.
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!! EVERYONE GET IN THE FUCKING BATH!!!
Is bbby suspended right now?
seems like it yes
# To anyone mad because it halted, we wanted it to rise so much it would halt.
KEEP BUYING YOU RETARDS
You glorious bastards!  This old man is to old to yolo, but I salute you.

Golf clap

Its an automated halt by NASDAQ when volatility gets into extreme ranges. Nothing to worry about just means some whales are buying a lot
Oh fuck I woke up to +800$ do I still hold it ?
Yes, idiot
Yes father
For sure
Yes (this is not financial advice)

Look at this guy giving out free advice
BBBY runs 70 percent before getting halted.  Gme moves 10 percent gets halted immediately
BUY THIS DIP AND HOLD YOU FUCKING IDIOTS
Just bought another 200 shares at 26.50
they laughed at us when we said gme was going to go 100+ and now they laugh when we say the same for bbby, with time good things will come. Brace for the dips, the sell-offs will be inevitable but if you hold through then you may be the lucky one who held to triple digits :)
Bought a 8/19 $40 call around open for 0.14. Currently at 3.23, up 2,207.14% today.  Well done, regards!
holy fuck lmao
Imagine not holding BBBY right now, the rush is fucking insane
THERE IS NO SELLING
These bitches selling after the halt
This stock is still only at $2B market cap. We’ve got a long way to go…
On a scale of 1-10 how much do u hate halts now?

#remove stop losses
This!! They are gonna stop loss hunt with all the halts that will inevitably come.
Short ladder inc, hold it boys, we ride again tomorrow
The chaos is fun to watch ngl
Hedgefunds can see your stop losses and are aiming for them!
70 price target
7000
Hopefully this goes up more. I want more huge gains
I think I’ve seen this film before
gme did the same shit just calm down everyone
BUY THE DIP. HODL
Man, rich people fucking suck for constantly rigging the system

Yup :(
Hodl and buy more
Oh damn this was the euphoria I missed so badly
Gambling is a hell of a drug
Going green on otm monthlies just doesn't hit the same as weekly fds going itm
I'm not smart enough for those acronyms
Alright let me rephrase that

Going green on **o**ut **t**he **m**oney monthly options due to implied volatility just doesn't give me the same amount of dopamine as weekly out of the money options going in the money

I bought weekly $25 calls on Monday and it's in the money now, netting me almost 2000% because of implied volatility.
they're doing everything possible to stop BBBY
BBBY halts and GME spikes 🤔
Almost like these two are in a swap basket
Idiots selling after halt
Sell at a profit to buy more shares next go big brain
According to my (technically) analysis...$50 eod. I'd rate this as a strong BUY with yuge upward potential.
Only people able to buy now are the hedges. DO NOT SELL. When the halt is over, the spike continues. We are in the NEWS now bbby
This volatility is stressful as fuck but there's literally no shot I'm selling
Halt didn't even last long enough for me to lose my erection.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Come on $BBBY, let‘s go party 🚀
My life is boring... This is the most excitement I've had in awhile
Just removed my sell button
8/19 45c

Now this is what I call pod racing
You got this bud
I almost picked up 100 contracts at 0.21 this morning but thought, nah, I’ll just buy shares. 

I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed.
LFG
Would I be absolutely regarded if I bought a call $45 strike for 8/19?
Nah it’s only Tuesday
I guess I’m retarded I have 2
Do itttt
You should have bought this morning, they were way cheaper. In my completely uninformed opinoin, buy lo and sell high. $39 8/19 calls were like $.14 a few hours ago.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
No. I did 30 minutes ago and up 325 percent. I added 2 for yolos
Yes
Every time they try to fuck us I just buy more.
This is the way
same
Fuck it I’m joining. With a very small position. 1000$
FOMO
Your efforts will be known.
another 1500$ in $BBBY, Todays high is tomorrows low
Potential for 30?
500% chance mid day, aka 150 right fking now
HIGH
Well my original plan was to exit at $25. I'm thinking fuck that, let's ride!!!!
250$ more like it
If you need to put a stop loss somewhere don’t be afraid to. Bag holding doesn’t help, if I were you I would just put it somewhere where it would need it to be crazy  volatile so you can read the patterns and cut out.
not a rich man so i cant just throw money at it. I hope my 2k is enough to help
Youll be rich after this
So all the paper handed ✋ 🤚  wimps showed their colors around 11:33am. Ok
3x the float traded before 12pm, how the fuck
This is the problem with people claiming there’s no way shorts can possibly cover so the stock must be going to $200 or whatever number. There’s plenty of volume on these runups so shorts can cover even within one single trading day and then you’re just hoping there’s enough momentum to keep the price run going and not actually squeezing anybody.

I’m glad people made baller ass money with this play but the folks posting absurd new price targets are just trying to bilk newbies
don't know if i've ever seen volume like this. not even GME. the amount of money moving around is wild
I BOUGHT AT $26 EACH, FUCK IT BOYS
Anything below 80 is a steal
I love you
DO NOT FUCKING SELL, I JUST BOUGHT MORE SHARES AT $26
200mil shares traded in 143 minutes

That's 1.38mil shares a minute

That's 23,148 shares a second
only 80 million shares exist
200M volume before noon wtfffff
I NEED TO SEE 30
28 is the next wall. Go smash it
Fuck it, buying more for the fourth time today.
WE NEED TO HIT $30 TO MAKE THE NON BELIEVERS TO BELIEVEERRSSS


LFGGGGGGGGGGGG
wooo 15 $22s and 10 $20s now ITM

contributed some gamma fuel for ya'll today

LFG
there needs to be more strikes for contracts after this week
Bruh!! How can I work on my day job .. this is unbelievable
I am all in for 1880. It ain’t much but it’s mine, except the loan for a grand. Wish me luck!
I just fomo in again.. fuck me
Guys…. I don’t want to hear “am I too late” or these on the fence bullshit comments at these price levels… WE ARE STILL ON THE GROUND FLOOR. Remember the fomo buying really came in on GameStop when regular people, not just wsb jumped in. We’re still at wsb level of buying mixed with some short covering. This is the time to diamonds ballllssssss!

Edit: somebody who is good at Dd needs to repost or do a new one with current situation to remind baby apes and old apes.
Pretty sure regular folks are gonna be traumatized from losing money on gme. Fuck normies
Some will be. But also some will be like holy fuck I shouldn’t have waited until 200 to buy and should’ve gotten at 40
I'm gonna Buy it right nowwwww for first time
Nfa, but I’m buying more shares. Staying away from calls. Cause this will take time
Fuckit I’m going to fomo more in. It’s worked out so far!!!
Last chance before 30
We breach 30 and it is game over
They try to dump it but then it pops right back up😂😂😂
Up 78000 today
Love to see  it
They are fucked $40 end of day
Stop selling, it's really worthless at this value.  Just hold
Up 40k and holding out till 100k+ Let’s go!
Yes sirrrr
##Flaccid wiener getting thicker!
BBBY might just cause recession. The true definition the whitehouse was looking for
I gotta stop watching the ticker a while. This shit is intense
Bullish
# $BBBY TO THE MOOOON
Guys this is nothing!!! Still technically the dip until it’s 60+ then just hold
My god the chart looks good

I wish I put more into this stock than a small gamble, but hell, it has made up my losses for the last two months. I can't complained at all.
I’m up this year now lmao
I'm still down YTD, but I wasn't as down as the markets. As in my account was down like 13% YTD until recently while the markets were down 25%. 

  
I digress, but BBBY is quickly recovering my losses. lol
Same I was poised to add AH yesterday but lost my nerve. I have been punished this morning. But all I have to do is buy now to repent.
I decided to add a few more shares just now. Just a few to make my position on par with my other boring holdings like MSFT. lol  


I digress, but since I originally got in around the $10 range, unless it crashes, it should be fine. My hope is to the $20 range, then keep watching it to see how far the train goes.
1.17k shares
i will always regret not buying the $9 dip ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
I missed a bid on 20 9.5c by 5 cents ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) dont dwell on the past or try to predict the future we live in only the present
Just bought 29 more shares!
Stop loss/take prpfit are worthless,  just buy and hold for a few weeks
I sold yesterday at 14 something due to a stop limit.
This is fun as fuck. 20 EOD LFG
Damn the things I'd do to a watermelon right about now.

I’ve recorded now 35 ppl telling me I’m dumb or stupid for doing these things and I’ll lose my money …. Can’t wait for the video I make using those recordings and me doing a dive into a bed of money …. It will be glorious and I can finally say I really do wake up in the morning and piss excellence

Grabed 50 shares at 19.01 hope we still climb
I have the same hopes
You’re in early, fellow ape.
you’ll be fine we’re hitting 100 by christmas
Imagine hating on something a young stud billionaire invested over 100 million into… 🤭
I would not be surprised if it hits 50 by EOD Friday
I would be very surprised, I'm expecting 50 to be well behind us by then
I like the way you think
Hoping for $65 so that guy will piss on his boss's desk.
another 500 at 19.38$

Proof or ban
Just triggered the top by FOMOing into calls. Did the same to stop GME the hedge funds should pay me for this service

Nah you’re good. This is the beginning
I was up 120% before the halt
90 mil volume already LOLL THEY'RE FUCKED
Volume is at 90 million.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
How is that even possible?
The only way to play this is buy those 45 calls expiring Friday. That’s what I did
I remember getting suicide hotline messages when it dipped back to $9 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) where are you fuckers at now

BBBY has finally made my account positive on the all time chart. This is only the beginning!
If you sell you're a booger eater.
Sell? I’m buying more
“Oh nyooo I missed it” SHUT THE FUCK UP AND BUY MORE
Still a while until we get to the beyond part of BBBY
Commenting for visibility 😂
I sold out of all my other stocks to yolo into BBBY. Thank you, regards. Let's ride.
Well we breached the $20 “resistance” gents. To fuggin Pluto we ride🤡if you’re getting in now you’re still early. My avg cost is 16.69 so I’m having trouble buying more but I’m about to purchase 25 shares.
god fellas, we were talking about it breaking 17 this morning... now it cracks 22.

$28 call by 8/19 did I go full tard…. Asking for a friend….. I’m the friend
Probably, I joined the fun foe the fuck of it but went out to mid sept. 17C were cheap af yesterday, like 3.50/con
True yeah fuck it
Don’t matter, you don’t need to be ITM anyway lol. If you don’t see it hitting your strike by EOW just sell tomorrow and roll out further.
Cool appreciate it I’ll look for calls further out
+276% contracts 😳
I bought $20 calls for 0.28 and sold them at 2.90 lol
Soooo hold C$37 for 8/19 is what I’m hearing
Haha you do you. I sold before a drop and bought more shares
I officially sold every other stock in my portfolio to fund this madness. Now 100% of my portfolio 🫠
Imagine being the dickhead that sells right now
Watermelon hands 🙌 😂
loop capital? more like... fuk
Fuk capital
More volume please
This feels familiar.....
I wish I could be a full time meme stock trader. The 1% of time things pan out is worth all the pain
Facts
Volume is insane! I’m pretty sure GME had the biggest jumps in January the days following the unfathomable large volume days. ELI5: you think today is a big jump? See what happens tomorrow pussy
lol I am up almost 200%
500 percent on options 🤪
I just keep buying and it just keeps rising ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Ok, i just sold my Amazon! Bought 25 MORE shares BBBY @ $22.50!! ! F IT! I'M ALL IN!🤣🤣 Up to 116 shares and nothing left to sell to buy any more! Here's my proof-  https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/ufFkEsmVj5x0

U da man! No, I'm sorry!! U da TURTLE man!😃👍👌 hehe! Hang on tight my man! It gets really bumpy right around here! But we'll be ok in a few, it'll smooth out soon! Hang in there turtle hands!
Kramer and his hedgie buddies are in panic mode
Millionaires are being created as we speak

JESUS IT HALTED
HALTED WOW
Liquidate those short selling fucks!
annihilate the elite hedge scum!
Interactive Brokers - TRADING HALTED ON BBBY
Guys… I don’t have a ton invested, but all I can say is I’ve been leveraged to the tits for like the past 18 months which a cash balance of 42-49% of margin… and it’s been stressing me out.  I don’t ask for much, but all of the sudden I’m back up to 70% & climbing… if I can erase this fucking margin debt I’m going to be so happy.  That’s really all I ask.
Halted trading my god!!
Now GME's catching up.
Someone got liquidated! GME went from doing fuckall to joining the action right when Bbby went ballistic. Meanwhile crickets for AMC
Kill em all?
Well, since we have a few minutes:

https://www.reddit.com/r/painting/comments/wpwpa2/recommendations_for_painting_a_face_on_a/
Did they halt trading at 75%?

Bro my dick is a scab at this point I cant
Shorts must be shitting themselves atm
GME up8% so far. Bbby is the catalyst
I can't believe this is happening again hahahaha

January 2023 is going to be fuck8ng lit
LOOK AT GME LOOK
DONT SELL!
Guys this is just the beginning. Remember how many times GME was halted and it kept soaring. This is just the first one

#HODL
The fact most of you don’t know why it halts means you are actually all retards
Than tell why
I'd gladly take their money.
holy fck both BBBY and GME HALTED on UP swings
I'm sorry I bought more I caused it
UNHALTED. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. DON'T LET THEM WIN.
PUT RYAN COHENS $80 CALLS IN THE MOENY
Back to $28+ please
HALT HAS ENDED BUY BUY BUY!
someone explain to my smooth brain is being halted a good thing
No
no never lol
Buy the dip!!!!
Buying the dip
BUY THE DIP
FUCKING BUY
What are y’all doing!?! Lmfao why sell
Shorting, not retail.
Bought more
Whoever was praying for a dip..
The dip isn't even a dip let's go
NO SELL
The Hedgies are DUMPING
*the people who were spooked by the trading halt are selling
What dip? all i see is a discount
Halts are always bad for meme stocks idk why anyone here gets hyped about them
I know circuit breakers are automatic but they're such a cockblock
Buy the dip fill the gap
halted.
This shit is so frustrating. Momentum just tanked after that halt
Hold the fucking line
Buy the dip
Hold the line apes 🦍
I think I’m halted on E*Trade
Same on Robinhood
People are buying calls that turn up 4x.. i am happy with few share though. 70 percent up. Not bad
“$20 EOW” they said.

Lul
Halts are the stupidest shit ever.
lol, it's standard for anything dropping or popping 10%+ in a small fraction of time.
Buy the dip let’s crank it back up
GME is still going, and so will BBBY! KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING
They cant contain both gme and bbby babyyyyy
these halts are like blue balls for the heart
GME RIPPING AGAIN, MEANS BBBY IS ALSO ROING TO BOUNCEBACK, MOON HERE WE COMMEEE
These ladder attacks are soft. Hold the line
Headed to 100 soon!
AMEN!
Looks like a breaker went at $28.04 for 5 minutes then is tanking!!! BUY BUY BUY!!!
$33 by the next hour
WE GOT EM BY THE BALLS BOYS!
RUN BBBY RUN 🚀🚀🚀
Thought I was probably throwing money away buying more at $16 this morning lol
I bought at 15.5 in pre market and watched it drop to 15.2 and thought of fucking course I bought the top. Glad to be wrong
Due to inflation
BREAK $30 and we moon
I'm in public and this thread and price action makes me laugh so loud. What a day :)
Imagine those who have bought since 4
4.78 here
I see some evidence that price hit 48$ a share during that halt despite seeing the candle close at 28.04.  Looking for more confirmation.
One of my friends watching the order book on RH said the halt happened because we jumped from 28 straight to 33
Entire fucking free float traded 3 TIMES TODAY ALREADY!!!! Fucking wild…. 🚀
I destroyed the side of the phone the sell button is on
There’s a sell button?!
im up 75k holding on
LFG
Meanwhile $BBY is up 5% without a fkin reason rofl
20k invested baby
I don't have enough money. If this keeps up for 400 more days, I will be debt free and be able to live life as a free man.
Not long now, 9 months will pass like that
Turns out I bought the dip this morning at $17!!!
Same here. Thought WTH I’ll grab 85 shares and hold it for an hour. Still here LFG!!!
CNBC doesn’t even wanna show BBBY, it’s up 65% and their silent for the hedgies
Noticed that. I figured "let's see what CNBC has to say about this..." Crickets.
Facts they’re in on it. They didn’t even give an update when the stock was halted that’s unheard of
420.69 cumming up

…gonna need A LOT of towels 😮‍💨
I fucking hate myself for not buying earlier
Fucking hate myself for not buying more!
you and me both, but here we are!
It’s always earlier until later
Back to gme stress levels
My account is officially back in the green after I sold my GME when it dropped like a PUSSY. Not selling this time.
My 26C 09/02 bought an hour ago is ITM ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
WE CAN GET IT UP HIGHER THAN BEFORE
Fuck it, 1.5k in
BBBY GME fusion dance !!!
Yes. Nice and easy to avoid another halt. Steady climb bois.
They didn't covered, buy and hold as much as you can please
Is there a ticker for water melons?
WMT up 6% today
Gotta get some calls on that
Imagine missing 15 this morning because it was too expensive.
More you buy and hold, the less shares there are for shorts to buy back. Price go to Saturn
I’ve 4x my investment. Jesus. I can’t sell but I know I should. Won’t.
Let me be your angel to say “do it”
GIGACHAD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Holders are golden - Keep the spirit mate 🚀🦍 To the moon 🌝
10/10 gambling addicts quit before BBBY reaches the moon
I love you all. Fuck the hedgies.
DONT LET HALTS SCARE YOU, WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE
Boomers safely investing for a comfortable 7% profit each year:

Redditors dumping their life savings into BBBY and making it moon 430% in a month:
Do that twice and you can retire.
Started today with only 5 shares and now I’ve added another 30 shares to that as the day has been going, we’re hitting at least $80 by the EOW!!!
who ready for another halt???

35 EOD?!?
UPVOTE THE THREAD
Its inevitable - Thanos

They havent covered. We going to 100$ garranteed.
Imagine being Cohen looking at his $80 calls 👀
Let's break the $28
300 at 14.20, xoxo to 27k guy for getting my attention. You will never be forgotten.
He crawled so we can run. Godbless & Godspeed.
They’ve shown us 28 is fear to them, now let’s make them terrified!
We havent even peaked yet...who the fuck is selling?? 🍆🍉
tbh probably some new short sellers considering the borrow rate refuses to budge at 54%. They're actually turning this into GME 2.0 with the refusal to capitulate.
For all you RETARDS

This is a NORMAL halt - it's a limit up on the NASDAQ. This is perfectly normal when it goes up 10% too fast.

This isn't anything malicious.

GME had several limit up halts per day in the exciting bits
Thank you
these people truly are retarded
The amount of people that clearly were not here for GME regarding trading halts is staggering.
I remember when it went from $150 down to like $60 in 15 minutes
Stop selling after halts you part-time fucks!
It’s transient selling nbd
Crime.
Here we go boys
aww shit... here we go again

Strike price 400$
Bought 7 shares. Life savings blown. Kids aren’t going to university anymore. We’re all living in a box on the moon.
So what you’re saying is, I should’ve bought more. Damn it. Lol
Man I love you guys. We are the short hunters
think about you starting a community of short hunters!
BOBBY HILL

Bruh… we’re gonna see somebody fuck a watermelon

Prediction: we hit 20 and paper hands fuck off, we all buy the dip and take this rocket to Uranus
I like this

I won my BBBY ban bet
Wow crested $20
Congrats to everyone who got in on this. I chickened out last Thursday and Friday even after selling other stuff to free up funds. Kept waiting for a dip entry that didn’t appear. Am an idiot 😂
GET IN THERE ASAP
We're in the dip right now mate
I wimped out early last week. Had like 15 at $6 and sold at like $9. 

FOMO'd back in at $11-$16 gahhhhhhh
20!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some are already feasting from this.  Last week one guy threw $100k into it and now he is pretty much near $200k
just put in another 500 kick it into gear!
Same here!
let me time travel to yesterday and go all in
You will say the same tomorrow, so buy more while is under-100
Finally I’ll be the one to water my wife’s melons
It ain't much but I bought 30 shares at 18 to show my support for the regards
We ain’t done
GG EZ
I'm fomoing my check Thursday fk it
WatermelonStreetBets

100% day this week I guarantee it!  Options chain is insane!!
Don't forget to bring a towel!
Who the fuck is pussing out?
Not everyone like money sadly
Why am I craving buttered watermelon?
Just put in $500 to convince my gf to stay with me after selling on aug 8 at $11
It went up 2 dollars in like 3 minutes of course it will pull back. All slingshots need a good draw 😏🚀
[removed]
DAT CRAY!
Remember the bigger mission bois, HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Rotating back into GME?
Order didn't fill 😥
Gotta go higher
Sucks
LETS FUCK SOME HEDGIES
BBBY bought back their own shares and they previously bought back above $18. BULLISH
RCs recent filing  shows us that BBBY is buying back their own shares as RC's stake has increased without any additional shares or options purchased
Buy more shares under $20 now or weight for a bigger dip?
Get in
Buy now or buy at 30
No bull
NOW
I have a feeling it'll keep climbing towards Friday. Showing support rn @ 19.5
>621 comments

13$ feels cheap now right?  well 20$ will feel cheap when its 30$....

get in now
fuck it buying More
100 shares, let‘s go 👌🏻
Cheeky bit of resistance at 20, won't even be thinking about it when we hit 30
Hold the line! BUY BUY & BEYOND
Picked up 100 @$19.20. Let’s go!!!
13.5 and 14 calls printing as fuck 🤠🤠
This is where the fun begins
What do you guys think it finishes at? I hope it GMES so i can grab a PS5 LOL
Same lol
[removed]
Tell her milf ass i say hi

LOL hits $20 and people freak out. If I knew the moon was only $20 I would be there everyday.
Hedges pushing back hard HOLD THE FKN LINEEEEEEEEEE 🙌🏼💎🍉🍉🍈🍈
Holding strong at 19 😤💪🏻
A true short squeeze will go parabolic like gme did.  These gains are nice, but they are nothing next to what we could see
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

It's important to relax and hold at this point, they are pulling these low tricks again, they are just getting desperate.
Pump this bitch harder you sexy lil bitches
Time to moon! 🚀
I’m literally sitting here hitting refresh. Going to $20 bbby

Does the stock have to close above $20 for Melon Kunis 🍉 to happen, or just hit $20?

Paperhand bitches we going to $69 EOW stop SELLING REGARDS
Thank you whoever said buy 8/26 17c last night
I didn't buy enough when it was $7!!!

BBBY 🚀🚀🚀
[removed]
Lot of profit sell walls at $20 even from other retail traders. It’s going to be a battle at $20
It's people taking profit.
GME had the same issue with 20s and 40s
OMG WE HAVE WATERMELONS 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
My only regret is buying 2 contracts instead of 100.
Same that’s why I just buy some more now picked 20
Couldnt resist, just tossed in $2k 😩
This shit bussin
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!
Bagholder spotted.

#FOMO is like the chicken pox

#The earlier you get it, the longer you'll have to enjoy the benefits
Just put in 29k fuck it
bought in at 11.22, for once I may come out ahead...once.
This is fucking bonkers
Cracked A 20 piece 💪🏾🚀
Fuck it buying 100 more
20 isn't nothing, stop taking profit! Just buy or hold
I'm guessing that's mostly the algos going insane trying to keep it down.  If people are jumping this low we don't want them in this anyway.  We need to hold for big cash and lots of blood.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)When u buy some more at a dip but it’s $20![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)

About to be in a meeting for an hour. Please don’t sell.

Yes

I have a sudden urge to have sex with a watermelon
The bananas are looking at me with great concern from the fruit bowl.

Imagine the FOMO once the RC news hits the entire public. Not everyone is glued to their phone. The squeeze will keep squeezing
What news?
That he bought more
Remember to thank the man by putting at least half the profits into the og rocket when this one lands..
Squeeze time Bbby ❤️

BUY BUY BEYOND
Realized profits and now I’m playing with house money. Risking every penny. Let’s go you fucks.

Same vro
COME ON BBBY daddy needs to get out of debt.
20c option bbby fix my pipes
What’s an exit strategy?
Too early, profit take at least at the triple digit
I’m selling at $40-$45
Haters gone hate but fuck it I held a bag for $AMC
It’s leave it to dance at each sell point 24….25….. then when it hits 30 you/we will either become men when it goes gme level especially after it hits the media or you can cry like a little bitch on the sideline…..however our 30 gold spot is still a week or so away;so you have time to become a man
Best day of my life
Can I kiss every single one here 🚀😂 wow wow
Looks like I can afford a hooker tonight boys.
I dont know what to do with my hands
In Cohen we trust
Do you think the people at BBBY are poopin themselves right now????
They should give live stream now
BBBY carrying my entire portfolio lmfao

You know what’s funnier than 24? 25! 😎😎😎

You know they are fucked when they have to halt
GME halted now 👀
People getting confused thinking gme is doing a gme again
Fuck that halt let’s fucking go
Paper hands scared of a little halt. 😂😂😂
Such bullshit, bbby goes up 75% then halted and gme goes up 12% halted. In both, clearly, they do not want Gme to get momentum at all.
LETS go 30$$$

Fucking bullshit. KEEP BUYING!!!

dip before the real rip
Lol dropped $4 in a couple minutes post halt... there'll be a downwards halt very soon, and that's the time to stock up again.

Go big or go... start giving BJs behind a Wendy's dumpster.

Another circuit breaker??? Fuuuuu
Held my $45 8/19 calls up to 2000% ten minutes ago— now they’re $0.01.

This happening to anybody else?
They’re halting trades
you won't get a real price during a halt.
It’s because of the halt. Hold them
no worries trading halts bring all value to 0.01
Mine are showing $0.60
Yes sir
I see bids of $20+ on Robinhood. Could be a glitch
that's because its halted, the bid ask is off so the price or your option is not accurate.
yea it’s just cause of the halt, it’s temporary
Checked before I noticed the halt occurred. I’m being a retard doing work right now when I should be here conversing with my true colleagues.

Thank you, my good brothers and sisters. Godspeed for 🅱️🅱️🅱️Y ✈️
HOLD YOU FOOLS!
They have halted trading but they are selling on us.

**HOLD THE LINE**
Another halt wtf
Pump boys pump #ExpectUs
Halt part 2. idk about you apes but last time halts were flying this high was when GME was ROCKETING TO THE FUCKIN MOON
Dont panic when its halted just geez
Mf we showed up on Wallstreet with helmets on and a 40ft long siege log. Resistance is expected. Hold the line. They are trying to shakeout the ones most invested.
FUCK YOU STUPID HEDGIES, I BOUGHT 4K SHARES, THIS STUPID HALTS MEAN WE WIN
Holy fuck
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Just hold the line, we know their GME next thing you know they will be telling us to buy silver buy the dip shut them up!! We are the biggest hedge fund and it scares the shit out of them
still buying (when unhalted), i mean the market cap is still just 2B, it doesnt seem like the worst trade i've ever placed. maybe like 2nd or 3rd worst
Dont paperhands now

Dont be that loan fellow who took a loss
Hedgies back up to their old tricks, halt then dip to scare the paperhands
I’m against manipulation too but this is just a halt calm down lmfao
Halted. Fidelity not allowing any action
same
Not even those nerd computers know what the fuck to do
Easiest HODL of my life. Turn off the buy button again?

Turn that shit back on, I know it’ll moon
GME was halted and now it’s higher than before it was halted, BBBY do the same plz
Bbby runs. Gets halted. GME immediately runs. GME halted. While GME halted bbby back on and gets crushed. Limit down halt. Just wow.
BUY AFTER HALT LETS GET IT 🍉🍉🍉🚀🚀🚀

Wedge forming. BUY NOW OR U WILL REGRET

Buy the dip!!!!
Bro I just checked the price for the first time today WHAT
Good MORNINGGGG
this thing over 30 goes insane
Easily hitting 30
Nice this is way healthier. Steady climb with steady pullbacks. I don't like that 10% up 10% down in 8 minutes game lol
When should I buy? I'm usually pretty good at timing the top of the price action.
We're not there yet
Cool cool cool. I'll keep waiting. I remember getting GME at $390, that was a steal. No one had a bigger bag than me. No one.
$50 tomorrow easy
Buy now we are in this at least all day there’s four more hours I’ve doubled my money in one day!!
Im buying the dip lmao
 Bro. Lol.
DONT SELL
Big market sell just got swallowed up. Here we go
Strong together
Called this shit at market open today, too much FOMO and shorts are trapped way too deep now, $30 today and not even venturing to guess where we open tomorrow.

[removed]
Starting to think it’s not worth the risk.

So next month we exercise our options and continue to squeeze right?
45 eod ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)

RELOAD THE TING
Keep buying! Let’s squeeze some nuts boys!
This is comedic haven’t seen a run like this in a few months.  Wonder if I’ll play it tho.
Every article coming out is FUD, man they hate when this shit happens.
They are SO FUCKT. Chukumba must be shitting himself right now.
GME 2.0 with squirrelyer but more investors because we all know what this is now. Imagine selling GME at 19 because “well I bought it at 8 so it’s a big gain” when you could’ve held for hundreds. Hold bully boys. If you want to sell for 19 you’ll have chances later.
Let’s get that 100 mill volume by 11 folks !
have been watching this all month. I got in today, finally.  Still gonna run but man did I miss lots of tendies
More to come brother
The best part is you know Cohen isn't exercising those options @ $80. I've been thinking in terms of $100 price target minimum by January because I know that dude fucks. Makes it easier to buy in @ $16 or $20
+2k woooot thanks wsb I'm going to to watch the artemis 1 rocket launch on the 29th TO the fucking mooooooooon
To $50 eod
#lol imagine being in the daily thread

Volume 100M sheeshhhhh
surprised no halts yet. means we're going just getting started
It doesn’t like being under 19
Loaded up another 100 shares at 19.07 wow that felt good
I'm glad that fuckboy got a watermelon
if this hits 20, its mooning
We already hit $20 almost $21 earlier lol
Don’t forget to set 37% of your gains aside for the tax man, they just reinvested in the IRS and small fries making a little more cash than the aristocrats planned are the IRS’ favorite target.
Come on west coast wake up and join the party!!
Just bought 80 shares
I YOLOed my tiny portfolio on this. Make me a believer WSB!
I’m a regard I only got 2 shares at 11
I have 3 at 19.75
That $20 Resistance is something
Can you fuck off with your limit orders
Slap dat ask
Last chance under $20....going once, going twice...
Here we go
This will go so high if we keep the hype up
Bought more shares @ 20.00. Keep pushing!
had 3000 saved up for my student fees but just dumped it all into bbby 🚀🚀
What’s behind 20 Kenny
A lot of paper hands at $20
$20 resistance is strong... 700 shares HODL 🚀

jan 2020 vibes anyone?
[deleted]
No halt till $69.420
Bro's the volume is nuts today
The best part about this is all those cuck ass bears trashing on yoloers missing on gains right now.

The worst part is I sold 525 shares at 11usd.
As I stated in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wn0x15/weekend_read_this_bbby_run_is_starting_to_look/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) last weekend, if this squeeze is mimicking GME’s, then we can expect fireworks Wednesday and Thursday. 

History may not repeat itself but it often ~~rhymes~~ mimics
BED BATH AND BITCHES
lol this bitch on cnbc is so disgusted at BBBY
They all rags there

This is all hilariously fantastic!  

I only say that because I have a bunker and lots of ammo...
I just want my 400 dollars to be 650 is that too much to ask?
That’s it?
That’s to little to ask. I want my 1.4K to be 25k

Fuck it, I‘m in!!!
YOLO

Thiss needs to squeeze to 400 please
They’ve lost control, PUUUUSSSSHHHHH!!!! 🚀🚀🚀
I love this community. Instead letting the hedge funds get away with market manipulation the people have banded together to create their own whale 12.4 million strong.
I love all you apes lol
I’m in a coffee shop and all these fuckers are working hard, I’m just buying BBBY and enjoying my coffee ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Same bro, only got 2 shares
There goes my student loan😍
Selling the wife's panties to buy more BBBY
What's your Cashapp?
£bubbleteawitchery
my position is so complicated now. I have a lot of shares, I sold covered calls on about 30% of them, I also sold puts on prices I want to get back in, and I also yolo'd some profits into the $45C expiring Friday to hedge against my CC's in the event of MOASS lol
I really need to walk my dog. Hopefully the price will still be pumping when I come back and I will hug my dog to death due to excitement. (No he will just get lots of treats)
To the fuckin moon Morty!!!!!
Added 300 shares .. lets good
Just picked up 10 more thats all my account cash so I am all strapped in
Ryan Cohen is a genius
What dip do I buy in again at? Lol
What dip? I don't see a dip.
That’s my point. Do I just buy in now or wait for a dip somewhere? It has to dip some point, right? RIGHT?
you have to turn the screen around to see it
I've been waiting for one since $14. 

Finally said fuck it and bought at $17.5
Sold my crypto at a bigly loss to buy more
i can’t believe it’s touching 23
It isn't just touching. It is penetrating
Don’t stop get it get it
Did anyone buy calls instead of shares? How did that go?
520% up on 13 x 8/19 21$c. I would say splendid.
Literally 500%
I bought $6.50 8/12 calls a week ago
125% so far
When did you place the call?
Early in the morning, like 8:45, but tbh I should have been a degenerate and gone for FD’s, those are at 350% up rn insane.
I did. I’m fucking flying rn
I have 500 shares…400 of which are going to get called for some 20c’s I sold. However, today I bought a 9/9 23c and I’m up 50% already. So it’s going ok…should’ve just went all calls, but trying to be risk averse a little.
Bought 9/9 20 C a couple days ago. 225% right now.
Good
I bought some at 14-15 I’ve made 600 idk if I should keep or sell.
printing like crazy! :)
550%
Bought 300x 60c at 8.19 share price, paper handed for a 2g profit… if I had held I would be up $50g. Feels bad man ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
i love you all
🫡 I am all in! Let’s see where it goes 🚀
ITM or close to ITM calls and share buying will send this thing, fuck these hedgefucks
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Bought 13, sold, bought 37 more
If shares. That's a wash sale
Que?
Look up wash sale on Google
That's just gains with extra steps
Idk but green now.
Bought 100 more,  I love you guys
50$?
When do I exercise my 7C leaps? 🤔
In January 2021 I exercised my gme 12c's that didn't expire until april
To the moon you fucking degenerates! 🚀🚀🚀
i had my finger over the buy button on a call that was .28, now .80. 😩
Those 45s?  Yeah I bought them yesterday
More! Moreeee
Sold GME at 11 in december 2020 and sold BBBY at 11 last friday AMA
How are you holding up
Kept 10 shares bbby because I thought I learned from GME, sadly just copium
Cheer up lad! I only got 6 shares but I’m happy still
How does it feel to never experience fun
Are you okay, we’re you at least up when you sold?
Do you use your paper hands to wipe up after your wife's boyfriend is done with your wife?
I am broke but here we are 3 shares against the big ol elite!
We appreciate your contribution, every penny counts 🚀🚀🚀
I wonder if deepfuckingvalue is in on this? Are you watching?
Imagine being short at 5 dollars
F

Halted now, but holy shit. Made the post on mobile, switched back en then is was $27

Bought 8/19/22 $45 calls purely for memes 10 minutes ago and they currently +40%
Bro I sold 8/19/22 $45 calls yesterday. RIP my shares.

All good, I have 12,000 shares' worth of calls currently approaching ITM
Is anyone else not even that excited about this growth up? Like I was in GME an AMC and at this point I know it’s going to just keep running and I’m like “meh. Best is yet to come.”
Yeah I fully expect 300 so this is just a tease
its a bit stressful tbh
Fuck it, 100 shares, godspeed retards.
Let's goooooooooooooooooooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
HOLDING my 4 shares til the moon 🚀

Are you sure about that
No but I am an idiot.
Holy shit other shits popping too are they gonna turn off the market today?
the 27k loan guy!!!! fuck man im so sorry

I think he either sold at loss way to early or his DTE was coming up and forced to sell, i cant remember
I'M SO DUMB AND BAD AT INVESTING GUYS I JUST SOLD EVERYTHING ELSE I OWN AND CLOSED EVERY POSITION AND BOUGHT NOTHING BUT BBBY WAS THAT A DUMB IDEA? IDK I'M AN APE THO FOR SURE

Bullish
Like the round bell during boxing.  Gives the guy getting his ass kicked a chance to regroup and drink water.
It's good. Some people with paper hands will freak out and sell; but people that have any weight to throw know now is the time to jump in.
gme was halted like 30 times its fine. will have crazy volatility but just hold
HALT
I feel sick. Please keep going
There's the halt
CIRCUIT BREAKER!!!!!!!!
Holy fuck DFV is smiling down at us from his ivory tower.

Trading halted. Halt will end soon and we can resume buying
Trading halted. Halt will end soon and we can resume buying
ITS HAPPENING
Which brokerages halted BBBY? Not Robinhood. Which did?
Tdameritrade
that's not how trading halts work, it's the exchange that does it not brokers
I am not following. If Robinhood lets me buy, but TD Americatrade doesn’t let me buy, isn’t that brokerages halting? Thanks for your help.
I think we just hit a circuit breaker
# TO THE FUCKING MOON.

Gme
Yeah GME halted too
HOLD THE LINE
we are NOT done
BUY BUY BUY
DISCOUNTTTTT
We are going to TOPPLE THIS ESTABLISHMENT 🚀🚀🚀
threw my 300$ bonus at 45$ calls for this week last thursday. Im a happy man.
I looked at doing this on Friday, and now I want to throw up.
dont worry buddy ill fuck this up somehow based on my track record.
How can you even buy an option for only 300?
Because last week when it was like 15$ the 45$ calls were so out of the money the contracts were a few cents per share. Its literally gambling and a terrible strategy dont ever do it unless you are prepared to lose all your initial.
Damn. No I won't haha!
HODLLLLL MOTHERFUCKERSSS HODLLLLL
History shows it may jump and fall in next few days, then jump big time (if follows gme chart last year)
GME showing a bid of $.02 on think or swim.. figured I'd throw in a bid for .02 as well
BUY THE DIP!!! MAKE THESE FUCKERS PAY!!!!!
JUST BOUGHT THE DIP!!!!! LETS GOOOO!

People panic sold
they can’t control both lol
It’s one or the other, thought we were the big retards
30, 40, 50, 100, 1000000000000!!!!!!
GME coming back. BBBY going to fly out of this halt.
🤜 🤛
The last time I seen halts this rapidly it was before GME blew up. Feet up and relax.
I’ve got an order for another 100 at 23.50, fuck these fucks trying to cheat us out of our tendies!
Who would even sell at this point. We are degenerates with a chip on our shoulder. 🚀🍌
I don't think you understand how this works.  Your 500 shares don't make a dent in their billion dollars of capital. After gme, they know the game now.  That was order flow and market makers hedging through an algo. Now they changed the game. Now they are baiting you.
GME x BBBY 🚀🚀🌌
The collab I’ve been waiting for 🤌🏼
BUY
BUYYYYYY
BBBY has GME potential. BBBY actually bought back their own shares making for a bigger squeeze. BBBY has Cohen!
God bless that man
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT BY SHF TO SCARE US AWAY, DONT FGIVE IN JUST FUCKING BUUUUUUUYYYY
CHARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGE!!!
Guys, if we keep this up then next week is going to be bananas.

Go, apes, go! 👶🚀🌕
And it’s only Tuesday
I'm so hard, right now.
But more weeklies for next week you say? 😏
Bulls always on top!
JUST BOUGHT $100 MORE
These sell-offs might scare away smart investors, but regards not scared.
STILL HAVENT SOLD AFTER THE HALT
Starving student still put in another $100
WE CANT BE STOPPED
SAME, I DROPPED ANOTHER $400
3,000 shares in & not selling … fuck the shorts!
MURDER THEM TAKE THEIR MONEY STEAL THEIR WATERMELON
LET'S FUCK THAT WATERMELON 🍉🍉🍉🍉!!
The bus is back and forth busy picking up Apes.
Hedgies really thought we had to choose between GME and BBBY 😂😂😂😂 I GOT BOTHHHH
Buy now or suck later🤡
Back to the moon we go!  🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚
SQUEEZE YOUR NUTS BOYS AND FUCKING HODL
time to buy the dip
I hope you guys bought that dip
Thanks for the discount, 50 more shares just bought. LETS GOOOOO!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Boosted my holdings to 102 @ 25.67
Lets run it up again gentleman. IM BACK IN
$500 MORE LETS GO

![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Wow. Almost bought $20 calls this morning and then I’m like “nah this will die”. Check an hour later it’s $25 wtf.
First time? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Scoped up another 20 shares for fucking 25$ i think im retarded asf
$30 $30 $30
What percent return do you guys usually sell your contracts, 500% or 1000%?
At 230% now, planning to sell at a humble 900%
We're supposed to sell?
Millionaire or bust
10000x or nothing
0% margin call
Picked up another 50 @ 25.13, Happy Hanukkah Marv
Fasten your seatbelts AND TIGHTEN YOUR ASSHOLES
My asshole is already right… unlike certain watermelons…
If we all hold we all win  
can't wait to break the economy again
Just bought $4k!! To the moon!
BUY EVERY SINGLE $3 DIP WE FUCKING MOVE
My dick likes the stonk
Exercise ITM options rather than sell right? That helps us collectively more so than selling?
Absolutely
buy high to sell higher
All I can say is whatever price it’s at now it will be higher a few days more so boys were going to hold to the sky
My calls just went from up big, to worthless, to back up in the span of 15 mins. What a roller coaster. Almost had a heart attack lol
What calls you take
Hold on to your choanies
and we have over 4 hours more of this madness
I have a humble 20 shares, like pissing in the ocean.
I got 10 lol I felt this
Every water drop counts
Hey, if enough of us do it, it'll choke whatever it needs to!
Together we have a piss ocean
I have 10 lol
Unless your the fish swimming underneath you…
69 shares and loving this
Member when people were freaking out about a small AH dip last night

Nice
Sold all my amc at a loss to buy more BBBY. You done messed up  AARON
Oh my god I broke even on my $12 outs and got out in time. Holy fuck thank god I’m not gay anymore

THEIR RICHES ARE OURS  TAKE EVERY FUCKING DROP
This is so exciting.
$30 babyyy let's gooo
Let at her go! FOMO in!
Setting new target to $50
EOW?
Possibly eod, it hit 28 already this morning.

But realistically I would expect to close today in the 30's and end the week in the 50's.
I'm taking a shit
Proud of you. Buy more bbby while you’re at it.
Same!
BBBY 200M in volume and counting
who got in on the dip?
Lol, who is not bro?
Next leg up is $30 for sure
Every time I sell CCs on meme stocks I instantly regret
Same. I keep rolling up and out but damn this is annoying
I just accept it and take my pennies
I have no dog in this fight and I’m pretty excited and happy for y’all!
Same, I just picked up a dozen to say I did, but am not all in hard.
In at $25.50, pussied out last week at $10. Probably the dumbest decision I’ve made in months, but let’s go baby print me some money. Make me feel something.
Good to see you back we just getting started
Same lol
I could only afford 20 shares tho :(
LFGGGG to the MOOOOOON. APES UNITE!
200 mil volume..fucking insane
no sell
How many people are skipping lunch today, I wonder?
THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. HODL!!!!!
This
Massive pump incoming!!!
Every day of turnover on these shorts will cause a huge spike at this point, get on quick
Threw $6k in earlier. Already up by $2k. Wish I could have done a hell of a lot more.
Threw 8k€ 1 hour ago 👀
I wish I were in your shoes. I put in $70 because I'm a poor boy so my 90% gain is still only worth about six pizzas
NOT THE TIME TO PUSSY OUT BOYS KEEP BUYING 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🤜🏻
Over 207 million in volume before noon. Let's pump that to 500mill!!
Insane! Fake share printers going brrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
So dumping my GOOG and YOLOing it into BBBY was a good idea today
Never bet against the apes
Realistically I want an older model corvette after this, help me fellow apes
If short interest in BBBY is only 55% then I'm also fucking Kim K

&#x200B;

$BBBY"
LETS GOOO
I turned off my phone and don't know my password to my rh account. This means I'm HOLDING.
Good Ape
i chose the wrong day to quit sniffing glue

When they have to keep writing new strike prices, just keep buying
It's going to 32 today.  +100%

211m volume boys. LFG HODL!
I’m now at 250 shares $21.43 average pray for me
RH removed all options beyond this week.  Is this a new move?
no they didn't
Do you understand how the options chain works?

HALTED !
Yea
Yup
Yes, some exchanges have temporarily halted trading on bbby. Fwiw, RH has not.
It dun frozed. I'm honestly amazed it took this long to halt. This is nuts.

+$82,000 today in my portfolio
Lmao market manipulation on the halts. Hedge funds can’t stand getting wrecked
Bro the halts are normal. Google "nasdaq halts" and you'll see a whole list
So weird that this only happens with meme stocks.
# $420.69 IS NOT A MEME

WE'RE EARLY TO THE PARTY!
Never was, just keep holding
Upvote this if you’re HOLDING. Let’s keep the good vibes going.

*mouth
mouth breathers know we dont sell. They are loyal, aggresive, angry apes. Nose breathers are too fearful for this game
BBBY entering low earth orbit and soon to enter space

Roll it back
Hold and then exercise !
Sell 25% exercise 25%. Hold the rest.  Not financial advice.

Ur human! You just found out you're normal! Yaaaaay😃😉
Roll it
I was thinking same date but maybe up to 20 strike or something
I’ll probably be downvoted but just set some trailing stop losses and don’t worry about it anymore. No stress.
That's what I have set up at the moment. It's a wise move for sure good call
Sell and roll them further out bro! You got the wheel going!
We are heading for the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀⏰️⏰️⏰️⏳️⏳️✈️🛩
BUY MORE
$20 any moment now folks!
Seriously?? I JUST bought 8 more shares at 19 each 30 minutes ago!!🤣 damn, that's crazy! F it, go BBBY!
I think we explode today. It looks like breaking $20 would eliminate all the sell walls as far as I could see. Would get super violent at the least
Just bought 10 more shares. Trying to do what I can with what little money I have.
60 mil volume already apes we have lift off 🚀🚀🚀🚀
HOLD THE LINE
I'm pissing and shitting and crying
Wondering if I should exercise my two $7 nov' calls. The funny thing is that I only have options on this stock and no shares. Also some 20 jan' calls. Its a little more intense to hold options through this than shares
I exercised some calls yesterday and planning on continued to convert to shares on the way up, thus helping push the price up... right? Not advice just sharing my crayon eating plan.
Okay fine I'm in!!! FOMO'd in at 17.70 after forgetting to yesterday. See you crazy bastards either on the moon or suffocating in the void!!!
The amount of comments on this post goes up at the same rate the stock is going up 🆙
OMG, will we break $20 soon? Keep going baby!
Is this a joke fuckin look at it
I literally wrote that like 10 seconds before it did. lol
WOOW imagine selling before it hits 20
$20 here we come!!! Hope that ass likes melon
Holy fuck we are already about to test $20
Watch paper hands drop off
I saw $20
Bought 3 shares doing my part
Good man. I went in on 80
Bought in premarket on the dip
20… 21?
Maybe 22
NEVER MIND WE GO PAST 20 TODAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Shorts r so liquidated they have turned into fart vapor
🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
I love this community so much
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Just buy 8/19 calls!!! You’ll make bank today!!!
Been having back luck with options trading. So I took a $12 profit and if I would have just waited 20 minutes more it could have been $200. My account is only about $300 cash account while I’m still learning. Needless to say I’m an idiot and I’ll see you all regards tomorrow.
dw im in for 200$ at market open u still got time
I only have about $10 trading funds after using my whole account to buy the 1 option. Lesson learned lol
Hop in the dip
20 already.. shiiiit

Sold my Walmart calls for this, buy buy baby 🍼
Stop selling!
Don't sell for chump change guys! 
Remember this I adjust the beginning

More first hour than outstanding shares…
I love the smell of the Volatility in the morning
PUMP IT UP
$40+ I will make a bed/bath/beyond machine
I think this is just the beginning.
New All Time High is on the tables.
i bought more... i cant help myself
stonks only go up sir
I’m so pissed I was looking at option chains last week but just pussied out and bought shares instead, I don’t even deserve my wife’s boyfriend letting me play his GameCube tonight
Shares is what this is all about
Don’t fire until you see the fear in their eyes boys HODLLLL
88 MILLION VOLUME. HOLY FUCKING SHIT
When I looked at my BBBY I was jacked to the tits, when I saw that the mega thread featured watermelon guy I lost my mind lol.
All my life savings in BBBY. Hedgies gonna pay
Buy and hodl you apes
Buy at 18.5
Late morning slow down, if it repeats the last few days, another run this afternoon
Buying in before this shit SNAPS
are calls worth it for $BBBY or is it better to simply buy shares at this point?
Shares IMO
just buy shares
Both. Shares will drive up share price
Shares are potentially cheaper and they also contribute directly to the squoze
At this point I’d say shares, I got my calls back when it was around $4 I’m so thankful
damn, what % are those up right now
Jan calls
80 - 514% 
60 - 455%
55 - 141%
Some others as well around 100% I fomod in on 

Shares up 325% tho
Short game -> calls
Long game -> stock
BUY
This reminds me of 2020 Dec TSLA and 2021 Jan GME gamma squeeze and my fds printing, euphoria time
hopped in with 790 shares today, lfg
I’m a pussy and didn’t buy after really wanting to last week, too scared to do it now, this place may not be for me lol, but I wish you all the best!
scared money don't make no money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
You're still well within the time to buy, join the apes.
This only happens every couple of years. I missed my opportunity also

Up to my tits in calls and shares and I just cant stop buying
Anyone eating melon Kunis after?
Should really squeeze mid 20's let's go
When you sold your BB to break even and hopped over to BBBY... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
My 21$ calls suddenly might be itm. How do I prevent it from being auto excercised in Robbinhood
What date?
9/9
They will auto exercise at expiration. 

Until then you're free to hold / sell as you wish
just sell it before expiration
You have all week before that happens. Just sell it at some point.

When I first bought $BBBY I told my boss I Yolo and already up $30. He said sell you and to stay out of WSB. Good thing I’m regarded and didn’t listen cause I’m about to be rich
My balls have turned inside out. I can only cum so much

My dick is dangerously erect right now
No pic no proof
sorry don't have a microscope handy
Remember guys at this point little dips are good in the long run for this very real squeeze happening soon.
guys remember, wtf can you do with a 10, 20 or 30k? Nothing, you go and buy shit and stay a poor mf withouth any prospects like they like you. 100k+ is where its at. Hodl
I used my Birthday money to buy stocks, bought some BBBY and made £200 profit in 2 days. Doubled down this morning seems stupid not to
bobby, get back down, we need to refuel!
i really like the stock
I bought 45 dollar calls for the meme. Turns out they are printing!
My order for 40c only partially filled and I'm up 100% and mad about it lmao
At what price do you think robinhood will remove the buy button?
probably fairly soon lol. they don't have the cash to sustain shit anymore.
After gme that's a ww thing, rh can't stop this time

Easily 300
Oh I wish haha that would be insane

Just bought 10 for the gamma squeeze. Will not sell and will work at Wendy’s 😃

Crazy that around 150% of the float has traded in less than the first two hours of the market being open.
What the actual fuck
Watermelon is getting bigger 😁

WHERE IS THE WATERMELON
We shall go on to the end, we shall buy in France, we shall buy on the seas and oceans, we shall buy with growing confidence and growing strength in the sub, we shall defend our stocks, whatever the cost may be, we shall buy on the beaches, we shall buy on the landing grounds, we shall buy in the fields and in the streets, we shall buy in the hills; we shall never sell, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this ticker or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the apes, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
I slept at open. Buy now or not? Only got 200 bucks lol
100% on $200 is still a good return
Yessir, this chaos will continue
25!

BBBY was at one point trading at $78, I won’t be touching that S*** button until then. See you there APES
STOP BUYING THIS STOCK AT HIGHER PRICES DIDNT YOU SEE IT WAS DOWNGRADED BY SOMEONE DADGUMMIT
Holy mother of fuck
BBBY, I can only get so hard. What you doing to me!
33 here we come
WHAT IS HAPPENING
If I get $1mil off of this nonsense, [https://gorillafund.org/](https://gorillafund.org/) is getting its cut.
Who said squeeze don't work on a Tuesday?
I bought and the stonk went up??????? Wtf is this???
$28!!!!!!!!
Bought 4 hours ago at $15.62 and set a triggered sell at $25. Which just hit. LOL
hey, good for you. solid gains.  I was mad I didnt get that price premarket, but stull picked up 80 at $16, not mad.
It’s starting. Oh. My. God. And you know what’s crazy? It’s still not too late to get in
HALTED UP LOOL
Oh damn. She's halted boys.
Here it is. They halted it
LOL HALTED
Lmao, that ask at 1500 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE YOU RETARDS
Holy shiet
THE FIRST HALT OF MANY
We're hitting levels of autism that shouldn't even be possible
We did it
America, fuck yeah!

Bed bath and beyond! Fuck Yeah!

fuck...yeah...
Hold as fuck guys
guess im not sleeping tonight
it halted. fuck them
And there it is, GME shooting up now too (albeit not as drastically) its baskets all the way down
Welpp game paused. Power out.
Holy shit. Got in for some more at 24 at what seems like last second. Today is crazy.
After a halt is the perfect time for a short attack to try to trigger stop losses. There are people who will get margin called if the price stays at this level and will be very motivated to push it back down.
Damn I was on a work call and came back to my profits up massively.
KEEP GOING. THROW EVERYTHING IN
I need to pay off my credit card debt
Its days like this when I treat myself to an overpriced SBUX
Wtf is gme doing
POPPIN OFF
Basket about to explode
just gme things
Is halting a good thing??? Does it plunge or rise after halt?
Usually plunges after a selling halt and rises after a buying halt.
BBBY gets halted and GME starts moving. Wtf.
nah gme started moving a little before the halt already
Holy shit balls!
What happens now
when it goes up too much it gets halted
Why is that….?
Excuse wtf is happening? Just checked after doing a photography job and it’s 75% holy shit I wish I bet the farm
It will dip once it restarts, put in limit buys slightly below current price to absorb and continue the rip
halted. wtf
Jokes on them, I just purchased another 5k worth around the 20$ mark!
I bought in 120 shares at 22$ - am I a retard? Or is this really going to the moon?
Yes to both
Mooon!
150 more for me at 21
Time for a sip of water
It’s okay it can’t stay halted forever 😂
#Remember when they said GME was never going to happen again?
Got another 20k ready once it is ungalted
A fucking trading halt lmao?

We broke it
Halted for 10 minutes boys go take a breather and come back to buy more
Trading HALTED!!
HALTED BY THE HEDGE DOGS
GME fireworks during the halt
holy shit - didn't see that and I have both tickers open side by side.  lmao.  I'll take all the moneys, please.

lmao - now GME halted
GME halted too lmao
If BBBY gets above 100 by EOW, I'll snort a Dorito
What flavor?
Sweet Chili Heat if I can find them, Ketchup if I can’t as a tribute to my fellow Canadian apes,
WE ARE BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!! BOYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Ryan Cohen absolutely fucks
WHAT IS GOING ON
Buy buy buy
HOLD!!!!!
GME halts just as BBBY comes back on.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Can’t wait to hear Jim Cramer’s take
Don’t freak out, GME dipped pretty substantially after each halt
then keep buying
And here I was think I was late to the game at $20. I love you idiots...for now. I'll probably hate you again eventually!
omg im gonna cummm
I like the stock.
Hooooold! God damn this is entertaining
350 million shares traded (on a float of 69 million) in two days, some big boy is demanding to be paid on those IOUs
Explain to a fellow regard, does this mean they’ll have to cover their short sale in 2 days?
Let’s see 50!!!!!!
AVG UP🚀 50 is in the spotlight
bought more calls
Juicy dip lets buy
So glad I added $5,000 of shares this morning.  Just wish I bought more.
I read 5000 shares which is almost $80k but I’m dumb af after reading it again. Lol
Don’t let them scare us! BUY THE DIP
HOLD THE LINE AND BUY MORE
GME got halted too, holy fuck my dudes this could be the start!
Buy the dip bbby
STAND YOUR GROUND APES!!!! 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
wish I bought more fujhhhh
Hold the line boys
Quick pit stop folks. Please check your seatbelts to ensure safe passage 50 EOD
hooooolllddd
It’s fine guys it’s going to be volatile!!!!! Just don’t be a puss
LETS FUCKING GO KEEP EXERCISING AND DRS IGNORE THE INDIAN CALL CENTER SHILLS SAYING THEY SOLD. THEY WILL DISSAPEAR SOON LIKE ALL THESE HEDGIES. LETS FUCKING GO BEYOND🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

HEDGIES R FUK'D LOL
hold the line chimps
We now this game
Does anyone know why it drops a bit when resuming after a halt?
People are scare selling. But it's perfect to buy.
🆙!
Crime
Definitely feel robbed, yes!
People get scared.
But what for? If it’s merely a market halt. Hold and nothing changes right? Or am I missing something?
Nope. You’re not missing anything. People just think halts are scary. Changes nothing, dip before the rip imo.
Because they are scared hold and we win
It’s algo trading, the hedgefunds see a halt and usually autosell.
Ah,thanks. Never realised that. Makes it extra fishy. Halt the game to give one of the parties time to recuperate…
Fear = sell off
So they’re trying to turn it into a selffulfilling prophesy? 🍆s! Not afraid at all!!
Classic dip after halt and then we go right back up
Hold the line!!!!
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE KEEP BUYING DONT SELL
Dip before the next rip halt
HOLD.
HODL!!  They aint got shit on us watermelon boys
HOLD THE LINE
Beautiful, sold at $28 gonna get back in a lil lower, gl y'all!
buy @ 22
**THE HALT IS OVER. BACK TO YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED MOON MISSION**
Loaded another $1000 bucks into my account. Keep dropping I dare you.
BUY BBBY!!!!
WRONG WAY
Hodl the fuckin line!!!
THEY PLAYED THEIR MOVE
Halted again
That drop is lame

POV: You’re about to blow your only chance at a lambo. HODL
Halt #2
HALTED
History repeating itself

Hold it god damn it
I knew people would leave after the halt.
Anyone buy this in their TFSA
hell yeah
Do I need to wait a year before I can sell it to avoid taxes
You won't get looked into unless you're trading too aggressively. Don't need to hold for a year, ape away my friend.
HOLD HOLD HOLD
This isn’t market manipulation. This is just what happens when this shit starts to hit
No it’s how the big money market makers get out of their shitty bets before it runs further. Totally fair and legal though for sure...
Buying BBBY dip as soon as it's back on
HOLD
KEEP BUYING
Ride it out an u will be rich
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
For the people complaining about the halt, you’re a little too regarded.
yeah.. it's not "they" that's halting "us".  It's automated
GME?? Is that you???
Alright gents see you tomorrow when we hit 30.
Hold the line bois!!!!
There officially battling the big boys now lads HODL
All these halts are just making me want to buy more
Etoro halted trading BBBY 🤷‍♂️
No. NYSE did based on LULD

GME dip and rip!
GME we will catch you
Watch the bbby bagholder cult form after it dumps

This thing is about to rip so hard. Some shenanigans going on here with the robuts, but apes together stronger than robuts.

Jesus - I bought in at 16 months ago, was fucked off with it, then it plummeted to 4, I just thought, nah fuck it, I'll leave it, next thing I know WSB is pinging away and I doubled down and added another few thousand - 525@10.20 - today I have 141% more and still holding because I am a sheep and I followed the other sheep - fucking amazing - I love the internet and all the madness it brings into our homes.

Dude if I was a short, I’d be shitting my pants right now lol.
How many more freezes we predicting today, boys? 3? 4? We getting some buy button removals? Maybe some “we lack the liquidity to make these trades” statements? What’re we thinkin?
Not sure bbby presents the same idiosyncratic risk that gme did, so no buy button removal should happen

Is it halted AGAIN? they’re really tryna fuck us
I don’t feel so stupid buying in at $14.25 yesterday now lol

🚀💸🚀
Ah, I see they’re trying the early March 2021 GME technique. This should be interesting, I think we’re all much wiser now…
You overestimate us retards
I just need a Elon tweet about bbby so bad
NO.  That tanks everything these days.
Keep that autist away from here
I don’t care who he is or reputation, if he tweet, a tsunami of his apes will enter
What about flooding his Twitter asking him to do that?
i bought 11,000 shares in 2019 because i thought it was an actual good investment… fucking amazing having all you regards buying it up today. will hold the line and stand with you idiots
Let’s see positions

Holy shit nice man!!!!! Juicey af
This guy stonks.
20 EOD I like the stock
Better to have some small pullbacks than an immediate run-up, thus causing a halt
Bought 500 shares at 10.55 on a lark. Probably time to sell...my car to buy more.
Congrats to everyone who yolo’d BBBY
Holy shit were actually doing it. #apestrong

Haven’t even hit our first trading halt yet. Covering hasn’t even begun!
explain in unga bunga
Generally if a hedgefund gets margin called and then forced to cover, there will be dramatic price movement to reflect that, potentially leading to a halt.
you know when this could happen?
Well no one really knows, but a looking at the one year chart a lot of people are speculating that around $25 is when it starts really stinging for the hedges.
ohhh cant wait, thx you smart ape
ohhh cant wait, thx you smart ape
ohhh cant wait, thx you smart ap3
hahahah halted
Let’s goooooo!!!
what could be the next Sting?
Haha I’m no genius, but another day with this type of price movement could be catastrophic. But in my opinion, you should just relax and enjoy the show!
Volume is insane whole float has been traded is less then an hour.
Do I print my calls or diamond hand them to $0?
$80c 1/23
Can roll calls to shares
Do you even have to ask

Hats off BBBY is really that guy
Amos Burton Spotted!
All my BaBBY boys please stand up
We just passed $20! Moon bbby!
TD will not allow me to buy more shares. Here we go again.
Is that based on their exposure though? You can probably buy more shares without leverage. My broker allowed me to buy 500 leveraged shares and as many as I want unleveraged
I hade a similar problem on fidelity but went on PC and it worked
BBBY GOT THAT DAWG IN HIM
Congrats fucks on bbby!!
lets go motherfucker
I was in 2 minds about going in on BBBY this late in the game, glad i did at market open 200 shares at $15.54 -> 27% up already
Fuck it I bought more
Got another buy order at 19.00. LFG!

Why do I feel like this hasn’t even started exploding yet?
Don't forget to hodl for the tendies apes, the squeeze has only just begun
Alright i get it to the moon, rocket, apes etc, but anyone wanna give me the lowdown real quick on what’s actually happening? Truly any info appreciated
The squoze is squeezething.
Depends which stock market voodoo you subscribe to, but… gamma squeeze
Let's fuckin fly bois
nu jävlar
Still waiting for my transfer to arrive so I can finally buy in too. FOMO is strong...
“Avoid this stock” - Entrepreneur
I am avoiding it like all the STIs 😂
The more it increases, the more ordinary people and rich investors that are don't even access this place will be tempted to also buy shares. 

We are in $21 now! Let's break to $22!
that buying pressure is unreal 😂
Guys guys I've figured it out...anytime I buy exactly 4 shares of something it moons...first gamestop now this. It's foolproof.
Can you buy 4 shares of my wife? I haven’t seen her moon in months
Can you buy 4 shares of my wife? I haven’t seen her moon in months

Oh BBBY BBBY
CALLS WOULD BE PRINTING RN
Where’s loan dude at today? I want to know when he fomos back in so I can sell
Lool
BBBY doesnt halt like GME! thats cool!
The MACD is showing an extreme power up immanent, if momentum up and holds.
First entry $4.70 - exited $11.50. Profit 145%  
Second run for $12.13. Profit 70+% at the moment. I keep holding on. Support by reposting my friend so that we end up on the moon!
Sold something at a lose to go all in!!!
Going on a walk. When i am back i am rich, promise me that guys
This is the real MOASS!! 🚀🚀
Someone teach me how to spend imaginary money like they do in the movies.  The $1000 I spent of my own isn't enough.
BBBY to 30 today, EOW 60
If GME got to near 500 BBBY is going near 500 too. Hold. I imagine 200+ easily based on how GME went
If GME got to near 500 BBBY is going near 500 too. Hold. I imagine 200+ easily based on how GME went
If GME got to near 500 BBBY is going near 500 too. Hold. I imagine 200+ easily based on how GME went
The hilarious thing is the shorts haven’t even covered. Loop capital will start to go in the red around $24-25 and they will start to cover sending this to the fucking moon
# CAN I GET A 22?!
    I'm here for the watermelon
Okay we got off the 20 resistance what’s next I have to hear it from someone

WHERE IS GME CORRELATION GUY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Holy moly
THIS IS A MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE
What did GME start at before it went wild?
about $40 ish it went parabolic to $150, took a shit to $70 over the weekend then went batshit to $400 ish.

It went from $5 to $40 over i think a few weeks, slowly.
It was around 5ish I believe and went to $60 in a day. Next day was over $100. By end of week peak was over $300.
Heart rate is at 100bpm. I'm just sitting down at my desk for a casual day of work 😂
why would someone sell at 20$ when we know what happened last time a stock was shorted this much? this could very well touch 300$
The higher it goes the more FOMO kicks in
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES LADS
Helmets on!!!! 🚀
Trust the plan
Holy shit
Well, holy shit!
300 EOD
# Excercise calls and hold
This is insane.  Love it for everyone, but I don't understand what's driving this volume.

Pretty much did the same thing. Got one 8/19 40c.
SOME EXCHANGES HALTED TRADING, HOLD RH STILL YUO CAN BUY IT SEEMS
Just got in this morning sorry I'm late for the party I've been outback Wendy's by the dumpster.

HOLD RETARDS HOLD 🗿🗿🗿
Why did my $80 1/23 calls go from 3.00 to 0.01 when $BBBY halted?
I want to know the same. It happened to me too. I went from being up $300 to being negative

Good job regards, we did it. #halted
SQUEEZE THAT SHORT JUICE
Why can't they just let it keep going up instead of halting it? I was about to be able to feed my family 👪
I was going to feed mine and yours
Trading halted on IB at $28.04. It's oooooon
Ok hedgies, have you collected your balls? Can we get this thing moving again?
Don't set BS stop limits cause that's how they're gonna sink us with these halts and ladder attacks. Set your sell limit high as fuck.

Stop fucking selling and hold you pussies
Buy*
you prolly won't get it for under 20 again, boys ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
I LOVE EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU RETARDS

HAVE A GREAT DAY
Love you too BBBY
I concede to you BBBY fuckers. Congrats on a wild run.
oh, it's just getting started
Halts often have a drop after, that's a normal part of going up too fast.

GME did it plenty
Please newbies read this
Hkd does not get halted and its goes from 100 to 1800 a share this is straight up crime
It got halted loads
easy. Retail did not own HKD but retail owns BBBY. You think the rules were made to help you make money??
I’m learning from my mistakes with GME and holding. Money to be made
How the fuck do they halt this. Hold the line they know they lost 🚀🚀💎💎
Halts happen automatically my friend. If the stock moves +/- 10% within 5 min
#I hope you BBBY bulls make millions!
Bought in at 4.77 do I do it right?
i

should

have 

bought

more
God damn. Same.
Chill out Oskar Schindler what you've done has saved countless lives
Upvote if you will tell your children about the great Bed Bath and Beyond squeeze of 2022.
my coworker saw i had wallstreetbets on my phone. he deadass just asked me if i was one those idiots....
You told him you were right?
👌🤣😎
if i told him and word got out, my career at the firm would probably be over.
Lol must be a shit firm then!
Tell your coworker he wont get a ride in the lambo
Its an honor.

\- Regards
And who’s the real idiot ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
peter is this you?
Well when you roll up in your Ferrari when you quit you can be like “yeah I’m one of those “idiots”
i got to breakeven first lol
OK regards. Do you see? It was automatically halted to the upside and dipped, then halted to the downside, preventing shorts crushing it and initiating a fear induced selloff. 

Halts work to protect both sides of this thing. The rules were in place before you started playing the game. It is AUTOMATED.
Real talk, this is the most fun I've had in a long time. I do need to play it safe and secure some cash, as I often am left holding the bag.
sold my options for stock, playing with house money now
Yeah, I think that'll be my play. Its hard to justify holding something that is up 70%
it’ll save you a future headache that’s for sure
This happened with GME too. KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING! This was a MM pump n dump
That halt cost me approx 100k in account value, wtf
They know they lost hold the line!
Can't believe there are idiots buying bestbuy(bby), it's up 4% 🤦
It’s rising because of $WMT ER
gotta love the sympathy momentum
I mean it’s only one letter off
Yolod my 2k in at 12....
I’m in boys let’s do this 🚀🚀

This is why nobody will remember your name
Bought 4.7 shares at 10.57 shootin for $30 ish lol baby R Tard here
Only 30? Gotta pump up those expectations lol
That’s fair hahaha I’m new to the scene man, I shall sit back and enjoy the ride. I see Cohen has a price point of $60-$80? Probably more reasonable? Teach me your ways you Fuckin Apes
Here's your dip. Get in now or regret it forever.
Let the paperbands sell. They can fomo at 50
ok I need it to go to $100 eod
BBBY Halted -> GME starts running. GME gets halted, BBBY resumes trading, the SECOND GME gets resumed, BBBY is halted even tho its not even being that volatile.. next level manipulation, cant contain both at the same time
locked out of RH for pattern day trading. i can't do anything. you must carry me to the promise land you  beautiful regards
Ultimate HODLer
The GME sneeze had 49 trading halts. IM NOT SELLING
# $BBBY TO THE MOOOON!!!!!!!!
If this isn't Market Manipulation I don't know what is.
We break past 20 tomorrow 😘🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Today **** at noon****
Tomorrow? It’s almost at $19 less than an hour into the day. $20 by noon.
We did it.
I just feel like it’s going to bounce back and forth between 18 and 19
[removed]
I like the optimism
We are breaking 20 today.
Hopefully 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You were right
Gentleman, ladies, retards, & my fellow apes... Let us push for $100 share.... Push for $500 a shares... Push for $2000....push for $8000.....oush for $billions.
101 shares at 19.7. Not scared
To all the doubters, now this is the LAST chance before $25. It will just keep pushing higher.
HOLD the line!!! This is just the beginning!!!
Hold!!!!!
I bought my first set of calls ever for this stock. 10c BBBY $25. Pray for me you filthy degenerates.
first ones free
its either free or bankruptcy.
expiration?
Sep 30
Solid... your calls are gonna print 😄
Same thing happened to GME
Bought calls at the top lmao... fuck
Hold, we are in this together. The siege begins.
bahahahaha
Imagine selling before $80 lmfao
GME is the mother.

BBBY is the baby.
KEEEEEEP BUYING!!!!! it can only get higher as shares become less avail!!!!! keeeeep buyingggggg !!!!
GME veteran here. Halts are normal, so are sudden sell offs. The pattern of BBBY right now is almost identical to GME in Jan 21. The general public (non-WSB retail traders) are starting to pile in. Today is probably the gamma squeeze, the real squeeze is likely going to happen and continue for the next couple days, possibly into next week. I think this one may run a bit faster since most people and institutions remember the GME SS.
Wanted to buy a dip, glad i took 16,2 now
I just bought in. Watch me lose everything
My fellow regards, we will be on the moon by midday. Remember your spacesuits.
Daily Megathread = $Bullish

Options call chain ends at $24 one good blast we'll blow past it like it's not there.

59m institutional owned shares but float has traded 8 times in the last week???

Guys, naked shorts don’t exist, they are illegal!! 

Sell first, ask questions later you morons…

I love this game.
That volume tho 🛏🛁🚀
Can you imagine all those paper hands losers who sold GME at $17? 😂
I love you guys <3
We’re only 60% over the last week… this is nothing. Wait till we’re up 10x
Let’s print some money today
Imagine not being part of history
Yeah I’m not working today. No different than any other day but now I can watch a ticker all day.
Hey Alexa, cue ‘I believe I can fly’.
Just bought at it's peak baby

Why is Fidelity showing the stock at 16.68 when everywhere else i check its above 17.4?
Fidelity doesn’t have live updates
Fidelity is usually 20 minutes behind
My widget shows the correct price through fidelity. Make sure you're actually logged in

Volume is killing it.  Puts on my productivity at work today calls for bbby.  BTW 9/2 options are pretty close in price to this 8/19
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
What's that mean?? Good? Or bad?
Thinking of adding some options today in addition to my shares… 🤔 only have about $500 more to spend. How far out are y’all holding options?
The 9/2 options are barely more expensive then 8/19 I didn't check further our dates tho
LFG!!!

Holy shit
I'm just "parroting" here, but if this follows the last 2 squeezes I took part in, shouldn't today/tomorrow be the first of the double-up days?... and that's not even counting the (possible) Gamma Squeeze incoming.
So much text. I just bought more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

$20 is a major call strike exposure. People bought them cheap and they are worth a lot. Everything is going deep ITM to exercise.

Just sold $20 CCs a month out on some shares to lock in profits. Pretty sure those shares are getting called away.

Does anyone have a confirmation bias chart telling me this is the moon? Cuz I want a confirmation bias chart telling me this is the moon.
FOMO is fun when it's just a handful of shares. It's easy to get excited about something trivial, and also to dismiss the loss of a hundred bucks or whatever.
Well, I missed this one. Godspeed

BBBY goin sicko mode.
I am sorry - I just FOMO'd into BBBY, so good chance the stock is going start dropping. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Nope, we hold, stonks go up. Remember, you like BBBY, right?
I am ape. Ape no understand. Ape bought option. Option expire tomorrow. Ape feel pain when expire.
ahh, so you have to sell today? :( sorry
The floor doesn't exist, there are still weeks before taking any profit, so just HOLD
Goddamn I wish my calls weren't expiring this Friday lol
why? make bank on those, and get more for later?
Because any (momentary) dip and the value drops significantly being so close to expiration
We still have 3 days, and this Ape thinks BBBY go to white thing in sky above. If their target gets surpassed then they make dollas, yes? Me no understand
We going to 100

Argh, shiver me timbers ye
Are we going to hit $25 today?! Hope there's not a giant sell wall there.
I thought the same $20 and blew thru that
True true. Let's do 25.
At this point when I see someone referred to as an expert or analyst, the correct approach is to assume they’re paid off to push a narrative. These dudes inhale L’s for breakfast.
HOLY FUCK
Buy shares and hold !!!

It’s still early days honestly, plenty left to run. It’s pre market and after market that scares me.
Been playing this fucker since $4 I feel so cool rn
How much did you invest and what are you at now?
So I’m only 17 so consider that with these numbers.  I’ve been investing in and out in 50-100 share increments and so far my gain from BBBY is at about 1300
That is awesome man! A gain is a gain!!!
Now this is pod racing!!!!

lots
Yes.
I recall around 5 \~ 8 times over the 3 days but don't quote me thu.
numerous, like it would halt, trade for 20 sec, halt… over and over

PDT rule is costing me a lot of money
#Pussys selling like a bitch lmao
💎 💎 💎 💎
Why is ask price 1500 lmaoooo
If you want to know how OGs feel about these prices, look at deep ITM options for Sept and Jan to see how much open interest there is compared to volume.

Ex: Sept 16 $7 call has 1674 open interest and 176 volume. So AT LEAST 90% of those OGs are still holding!
I wish shorts posted their loss porn in WSB
Chill regards. I need to get shit done, can we go back to daily 10% increase ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Sorry did I say 80$? I meant to say 800000000000$!!!
Wtf am I seeing that correctly? Nearly 200 milly in volume?
It’s GME all over again. I hope they go broke and their algorithm CPUs melt.
How does this compare to the GME volume back in the day?
Just the start. hodl
Keep buying we gonna hit high

GME HALTED. THROW GME IN THIS MEGATHREAD. 

I love all of you.
They halt it to scare people Hold
I feel like wearing high heels and make up after seeing my small profits, but not sure my wife's boyfriend will approve.
I don’t want to take 100% credit for getting us a megathread… but I will!
Good morning Regards
Thank you very much😉
BBBY will climb to 100 then GME will climb to 1000 then BBBY will climb to 500 then GME will climb to 1mil then
Then?
Use your melon 🍉 imagination
Well I'm waiting
160 shares with a 10.50 usd average. Let's hope we bump up into the fucking stratosphere.
Speak friend and enter: 

"Melon 🍉"
All in…..remember buy actual shares! Options are good add-on’s but shares will force the squeeze
This feels exactly like the beginning of the GME moonshot.  Only difference is I got to this before lift off
As usual. It drops after I buy. Wtf
This didn’t age well….and that’s good :)
They are so scared of $20
I just got 200 at 20 so it should drop hard any minute for those that didn’t get in last week.
Could always sell weekly calls? The IV is crazy (Coming from a call holder).
Feel really bad for the 27K loan guy😂😂😂
Game stop was about 187X more than it's 5 year low when the sell button was turned off. 

For BBBY you'd be an idiot to sell before 600USD per share.
Wtf I invested 20 minutes ago and made 600 bucks THANK YOU WSB
20 seems like a long time ago now
Boys Im 100% profits but this shit will fly over $100. simple as buy and hodl
Got in at $8 just wish I’d had money to buy wayyy more 😭
Uh oh... the poors are making too much money. Time to halt LOL
did the suits halt this? Free market my ass 

FUCK YOU. I am tried of being a wage slave. I am playing your shitting game and you bend the rules when we win. FUCK YOU
First time?
nah. been here before GME saga. hence the massive debt. I'm just tried of the bullshit
#PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LEARN ABOUT HALTS BEFORE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM.

#I KNOW YOU ZOOMERS HATE GOOGLE BUT JUST FUCKING LOOK IT UP PLEASE.
Can you explain It?
did I stutter?

fucking google it.
Can you put that In fortnite terms
Free market my ass. Fuckin crooks! I LOVE THIS STOCK 💙🫡
DONT FUCKING SELL, THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS AFTER THE BREAKER TRIPS
So when we group buy a stock it’s market manipulation, when they halt the stock and kill the momentum, it’s a correction..? I’m disgusted.
Before the rip must come the dip
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
the short ladder comments are back and they halted GME as well. Feels like 2021 again.
Stocks get halted everyday, it's an automated process it's not rigged against you
I know, I didn't said it's rigged
saw gme was down first thing this morning and didnt realize its up almost 12% now. basket theory is basically proven now.
What is basket theory?
essentially hedge funds and institutions combine certain tickers into "baskets," basically going long or short on the group of tickers as a whole. This explains why BBBY, KOSS, GNUS, and others squeezed when GME did. It would also explain why they move in tandem despite some of them being in different industries.
Oh, thanks for the explanation
No problem! no one truly knows however so take it with a grain of salt!
They fucking froze it 2 times today?
they'll do it a couple more before EOD
Yes
Didn't they get the living shit sued out of them for freezing gamestop?
Doubled my last two paychecks, should i quit and survive off eating crayons ?
No. Survive off cardboard. More nutritional value.
Thank you for your sage advice, going to bed bath and beyond to buy as many mattresses as possible to maximize cardboard volume
Hold till end of week, re-evaluate on Friday

If this hits $500 today i will shove a diced watermelon up my ass and eat it afterwards
We’ve got a live one!
Wow. Only a penis simp makes bets that won't eventuate. Lower it to $20 and we have a deal
You know what would be super dope? If BBBY made their buy buy baby announcement today 😏😏
# BBBY TO $420,69 IS NOT A MEME
Bought 100 shares this morning and 2 calls.
Call your wife's bf and ask him to send you nudes
only bought 40 shares and pussied out of buying 100 more thinking thered be a dip where i could buy more fml
Cancelled my $10 orders this morning.
Bro... Ain't that the truth
Chances are that there is going to be a dip. Should have plenty of time to buy more
Mate if 30 EOD i give my mother 1000€
Wow they froze it, the cocksuckers
Woooooow this is criminal
Wait GME wyd????

I like the stock BBBY!
Bought 15 at $26
Lmao now that’s retarded ! Welcome aboard!
Price is cheap still, buy you fucking morons!
132 @ 14.47………..GODDAMN it why was I a pussy yesterday
You can still buy more ape![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Same.  Bought back this morning for $2 more than my sale yesterday.
Best part about this is amc being down😂
They had so many warnings pointing out the common sense that their CEO constantly wanting to dilute their shares wasn't a good idea, yet they claimed it was all FUD. They're a lost cause.
Yup got banned 10min ago when I told them we warned them😂
lol Bought the peak.
Like a true retard
HOOOOOLD🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
Master!
same, as expected
here comes the manipulation
manipulate my nuts
that would require you to remove your hands
real and true
Stop selling you paper handed bastards!
#I shorted BBBY at $8 now I'm losing everything!!
retard
Are we hodling boys ??? This gains ain’t cutting it yet I rather lose a bit then sell for small gains
Hold
Damn, I really just turned $1000 into $20k. Not selling yet
Just sold 500 shares of amc and 4 call options to buy 1000 shares of BBBY. Popcorn was nice, but I like towels to wipe off the liquid.
😂😂 bot/shill with your 20 day account lol
Nah, not a bot. I just use this account to watch porn while my wife’s boyfriend visits.
Been waiting for the first rug pull since 10$ to open a position and instead I've watched easy money fly by. What a loser.
True.
I've been in the same boat. Finally bought in today.
Amazing 20.75 what a feat. obviously someone has to be shitting themselves right now but WE GOT THIS. This is our time!
The battle for $20
Bought 10 little shares at 9.65 because I was afraid to gamble... I could have bought at least 4x that? so still not a lot but at least more 🥺 lesson learned: take the bet. 

This is my first experience buying and watching shares and I'm having a blast🤘😌
a win a is a win
Don’t worry you’re doing fine!
This is the last day to get in before phone numbers.
Guys, we can do it, we can 🥺
Just sank my life savings into this. Keep charging.
Just bought another 300. Just realized they can't turn off buy button this time. Shorts are screwed
Realistically I can see this going up to 1000$ within the next couple of weeks
1000$? are you sane?
yep, with the short interest and options that will need to be exercised(assuming sold naked)
Not insane, just retarded
Realistically what are we holding too? 48 86.5 130?
This is just foreplay
To The Moon 🌙
Between now and friday 25-30, then 70-85.

Or something completely different I have no Idea im retarded dont listen to me.
420.69 is not a meme
$130 would only be a market cap of around $7b - well within possibility. I think peak is in the 2's.
God damn I’m such a fucking idiot. 

I bought in. 

I may have gained 15% but I’m still an idiot.
Not an idiot 
Better now than never
Did the same yolo
I bought in a week ago at $9usd. About to touch $25 so I’m just giggling like a school girl over here
Im just surprised it took them this long to halt us lol
You know it’s real when they start halting us
I FUCKING LOVE YOU CUNTS
Seriously!?! Halted?? For how long??

75% gain in a single day... how the hell did they not halt it BEFORE now? lmfao i wish i had brains
Those old ass elites have halted it. Corrupt shit they don't like us
Not to be a dick, but get a clue kid
these halts are mad sketch
Stop loss hunting.
Don’t use stops.
Halted again!! Da fuck
Just don’t fucking sell
It’s not done falling, wait for it……….
REMEMBER, they did this before, a flashcrash. After that it Ripper!!!🚀🚀🚀
my teacher is taking our phones away for 3 hours, how will I be able to trade??
tell her buy bbby and to get off your nuts
Ditch school this is where the real money is
Pay her $200 you’ll make that in no time lol
Leave
Fucking leave the school
Call your moms boyfriend give him the account info
Kick your teacher in the balls
Who sells after a halt?? Lol
how long should I put my chicken thighs in the oven?  skin on @400

thanks lads

edit: just threw these in the over for 40min with a lot of salt and some dry rub.  fabulous delicious excellent.  still have a few lb of chicken legs so i'll try everyone's suggestions going forward
30 min. And season it please.
45 mins on a baking sheet, 1 hour if it’s in a baking dish. Honestly turn it down to 350…..last 15 mins crank it to 400
Use a thermometer. Don’t get sick. 165F. But rub some butter on that skin so it’s get crackly.  And DON’T FORGET THE SALT.
wait, for real,  I should be buttering my chicken before I put on the dry rub?
Boneless? Probably like 15 minutes or so. Check to make sure the juice runs clear.
15-20 min on broil
35 minutes bro, 40 if you want em crispy
40 mins roughly. I wouldn’t mess with them while they’re cooking either.

Just found out my friend is stranded at $40. Think we can save him?
Long term value holder, a true degenerate, nice
as someone who was here wayyy back and bought into GME when it was still below $5 - let me give you some advice:

Take some profits to keep your initial investment and then play with house money.  There's nothing paperhanded about making money.
I am doing small sells at intervals till I recoup my cost basis + 10% to cover margin costs. Then after that riding to heaven or hell with house money. Not making the same mistake I did in GME
You shit on memestocks on your posts and now encourage people to sell. Shill.
I hope you lose all your money.  Fuck off with your fractional shares.
Exposed
I only have 3k but I'm here to hold. 💎💎💎💎

Sell, then go hit that watermelon.
Sell your gf
Sell your girlfriend and double down
In my experience that is usually the moment when it tanks and you regret not selling for more reasons than one
DOUBLE DOWN YOU FUCK!

News from Chase, BBBY hitting $100 end of week before crashing. NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY
#Why they halting my bbby
Etrade tell me - Trading is halted on this security.
Robinhood saying the same thing
Halt!
Halted, these fucks never learn
sold at $17 rebought at $20 

profit is profit
KEEP BUYING RETARDS. WHEN GME HALTED WE WENT TO THE FUCKING MOON
Some of you retards need to learn what a circuit breaker is
> Volatility Halts

> Volatility halts are single stock circuit breaker halts that trigger 5-minute halts on fast price spikes or drops that exceed the acceptable trading price range (ATPR) for 15-seconds. The ATPR is calculated as the average price of the previous 5-minute trading period.
Another HALT?

downward halt, fuckin fat sell order
Honestly we would have reached 50 EOD if halts didn't exist. Everytime I refreshed the app it went up 3%
Would anyone here not have sucked a dick yesterday just for it to jump 50% today? You'd be doing cartwheels, this shit is fucking mooning and if you hop off now you really are eating crayons
bullshit halt!
That drop was insane. Reminds me of GME March 2021.
Flashbacks

Goddamn this is a bit like January ‘21. Are these… feelings I’m having?
Imo so far, Jan '21 was like hitting the crack pipe and this is like a light beer buzz to me. My stake was a lot higher back then though to be fair
For sure - it’s the anticipation of hitting the pipe together one more time that has me buzzing.
Yeah we can only hope for greater thrills and more dopamine hits this time. Who knows what happens though

Why is Jim Cramer urging BBBY to issue 20 million shares?!  What is his incentive?!  Would they actually do it?!  What would happen?!
Nobody listens to cramer, he wants them to dilute us to push down sentiment
I know, but why???  What's his incentive?  Who's pulling his strings???

I asked the same thing. Got in 100 @ 19.21.

No price target only up
Maybe 30 EOD rather than EOW.... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
This explains how "market makers" are shorting without find the stock.   Specifically mentions Citadel using this exemption.  No wonder Cramer and short hedge funds in full blown panic with a BS "downgrade" today too.  BBBY can go more parabolic than $AMC and $GME without HOOD having the ability to turn off the buy button https://mobile.twitter.com/dlauer/status/1559201020332457984
slept in and woke up +10k thank you regards i love it here
Ahhhh now there’s the market I know and love. LFG!

Holy shit stocks really only go up. Do I keep buying? Wtf do i do with my hands?
Keep buying!!! $23 is low cost relative to where it will end up

Doesn't matter, just keep those diamond hands
ofc just need to know a good grasp eow to get a good idea of how much i can buy when i get my pay check🚀🚀
$30 EOD is looking really possible
Would not be surprised if we get 350 million volume. We’re already close to the volume of yesterday, 125 million.

BBBY is fucking unreal I'm jacked like a fucking god atm
Sozzi said to read 10-k I say put on your helmet and enjoy the green crayons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🚀🚀🚀
I’ve heard of a K-9 🐶, no idea what he’s talking about
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
keep in mind, the shorts most likely got in from the $4-8 range.
They were in at $25
This is going nowhere but up my dude
Holy shit I bought the shares because I liked the stock now I like it even more.

Edit:Where do I donate to the artist who is painting Mila Kunis on the watermelon?
Me as well. Just bought with what money I had left. With that, a monocle and tophat appeared on my head. Am I bourgeois?
I just keep buying every dip for two weeks and it keeps on working!  Gonna continue lolz
Holy fuck what was that
I like the stock so damn much
I like the stock
HOLY FUCK. if only I had money to buy more T.T
I am sooooo sad that I didn't have more money to buy in. 20 shares at $9.04
There’s no way this doesn’t get stopped up for a few minutes right?
Shit just jumped 2$ 🤧🤒
Fuck this fucking sell wall
Pinned at 23.

Wish I held onto my 15C for one more day :(

Should I buy more!?
Yes
Yes
ITS FLYING
BBBY 150M in volume in a few minutes
I'm starting to think that BBBY has the potential of out out performing GME during its run. September is typically the winter of the stock market, which is perfect as people might sell their other positions for BBBY!
Only need like a 1.5x for $60’s
This is WILD!
spreads are getting nuts.  exercise on short term very ITM calls and buy back in if you want.  Extrinsic value going down down down.
This is crazy
MM are not even covering... there is ALOT of upside on this BBaBY..
Need to see some watermelon fking

$15 call for 8/19 just hit 1k
If they don't halt is we gonna be driving lambos by next week

Basically that particular ticker can’t be traded for like 15 mins cos of how volatile it’s being. That’s from my understanding anyway
GME IS SQUEEZING SIDE BY SIDE BBBY
Would ya look at that!
How long does a suspend normally last?
15m
5 minutes if I'm not mistaken
Gme, rev, bgfv and vrm all moving now
We’re gonna bankrupt these mfs one way or another
Sold my calls seconds before the halt. Made over 1k today. Will buy in again on a dip

*laughs in bobby*
WE DO THIS SHIT
Popping off?
yes
I like it. Buying more
Anyone got Ortex data?
Stash fucking sucks they have the stock listed for $23
Stash is for investing long term my brother in Christ. They submit orders only a couple times a day, so by the time you get in the price will have changed drastically.
What app or website do you guys use?
🚀🚀🚀
I have options expiring Friday, is it better to exercise them or sell the option off?
Exercise
Exercise if you have the cash. Force them to buy 100 shares for you
If you think it'll keep running you have two options to remain long:

Exercise them for the shares

Sell them and buy higher strike calls
Purchasing shares helps push the price though right? It’s only 5 contracts to would just be a drop in the bucket, but every bit helps right?
That's a dumb way to think about investing your own money. You're investing for yourself.
Exercise if you have the money, or else sell them
#finally thank god
God*
#allah
It's amazing to see. A few red candles followed by several more green candles. $30 eod might be a low estimate.
URANUS 🚀

You can for 8/19 and jan 23 expiry
100 upvotes I WILL BE NEW WATERMELON GUY
Remember boys, hop out once normie news catches on
Normie news has been on this for over a week, ignore the FUD
This is the way
BBBY squeeze in Aug22 will be bigger news than GME squeeze in Jan21
Bruh this is fucking awesome. My 18 shares 🤌
How is it even legal for them to halt trading on stocks jumping. The government a sham! Hold bitches
If a stock moves 10% up or downs within 5 minutes, it automatically halts to stabilize the movement. It has nothing to do with the government och hedgies, you retard.
Tell that to the people who lived through 1987.  There is a reason.
How much money do you retarded apes want to to throw down to make BBBY bust for hedgy tighty whitey by this coming Friday?

Help us distract those crayon sniffers by making the smartest plays and post on WSB please

I need you all bad this week. I will tell you whatever makes you wet on DM

Til then, see you again space cowboys
How long did it take GME to get to $300 after hitting $30?
Around 2 weeks I believe
\^\^, went from 80-300 in like a week.

sauce: I paper handed at 100
I shrugged it off at 20 that the idea would never happened and then got scared to buy in so watched it go higher and higher without being able to get some gains.
Now I’m balls deep in BBBY though
a week
About a week. I watched my $40 call I bought at $16 go to $130 in 3 days and sold it. Then it shot past $250 a couple days later that week.
Like 3 days
Ya'll gonna be rich! Watching fom the sidelines ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
so it finally starts skyrocketing up and up and up and you fucking sell before we could touch 18?? grrrr
Break 18 you slut
Already way above, lfg
Bought 14 back at 11 . Just bought a new car all the play cash I had let's go!
Ive paperhanded at 13$ just fomod back in im sorry guys
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)I love all of you regards![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)🌚 🌝 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Its happening monkies
Buy the dip
Anything below $20 is now dip. Then 🦍🛫🚀🛸
Is $80 realistic?
EOD? Yes.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
You sound like a bear!
End of the month maybe.  But it's not even the floor
Can we have live stream from BBBY head office please? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
It’s such a healthy stock. I love the bounciness
And I thought it was over at $12…
Reminder that the all time high of bbby is in the 70s, but not after this week 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Doubled my money, thank you apes.
Still holding?
Cautiously.
GME apes getting PTSD watching the volatility.....
LFG!!!!! WE GOTTA HIT $60++++
Hey look its me who bought $6.50 9/9 calls for $1 and sold that same week for $2.50. no don't worry I don't have any regrets at all right now!
Profits be profits
Haha i did the same - calls made me 100% and i cashed out 💀
50 more. 350 total. 

Put a stop quote to sell at 17. Secures profit while letting me continue to ride
Really getting into that $GME mentality here
People always how after GME the sub went to shit. But that was the most glorious moment of this sub’s history.
Really shoulda sold AMC to buy BBBY last week huh.  I  cant trade stockz. Im so bad at this.
BBBY Halted :(
This is good. That means shorts need time to cover and rally will resume
Halted?? Thought this was a free market
I mean that hit the trigger for sure
REMEMBER. IF WE CLOSE ABOVE 26 ON FRIDAY, EVERY OPTION THIS WEEK IS ITM.
i bought some 45s 1 hour ago that expire this week
Ah my bad nasdaq had them only up to 26.
Not this week, but every option of next weeks chain is already ITM at $26
G A M M A
The Halt just gives me time to move my mouse so I’m active on Teams again
This is the way
They halted it. Fucking scum
Did these mofos just halt trading??
It's back
Tf type of corrupt bullshit
Someone said it's because the system can't keep up with so many orders they have to halt it temporarily but I dunno if that's true maybe the big boys are scared
Trading halts and then when it resumes the price drops $5 in a couple minutes. Either they are heavy fucking with it, or they scared alot of people

They just shorted the fuck out of that top
why do they halt when its going down
so it doesn't crash
but arent they halting to get it to go down?

same reason they halt when its going up
BUY MORE
Hold the line ya cucks.
Watch people moving it into GME in real time. Good on you buggers!!!
Dude right?! 🥹
What are the rules on halts? How many times does this happen?
As many times as it needs, basically the halts stop mass panic selling and buy raiding of a stock, tries to keep things ‘Orderly’
+/- 10% move within five mins. This is usually when bag holders are made.
Thanks for the insight. Does it have to go down too? It has been plunging up more than 10 percent/five minutes for hours
i think 3 a day? the third stops everything until the next day i believe...
Don’t fuckibh sell u pussies
Bought some more. Show them who is the king in the jungle. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
They disabled the buy button
Never forget
BUY brothers
might fomo into some BBBY to help the cause
and here I was, thinking gamecock was a once in a lifetime opportunity
Turns out, all it takes is a bunch of actual dipshits to overshort a company that isn’t going bankrupt (at least for a few years).

As long as they don’t learn (my guess is their hubris will be their downfall), the infinite money glitch continues.
Just put in $700 more LETZGOOOO
800$+
Keep buying guys!
they don't wanna see us win
I can take 200% profit on this (you would call me paperhands, right?) 

or hold and believe in 80$ 

&#x200B;

WHAT DO

**WHAT DO**
HODL PAPER HANDS
Believe
Sell 40%, hodl the rest
HODL HODL HODL
We carry on lad
just sell some ? or do u only have one contract
80$$$!!
HOLD FAST BRÖTHER

WE ARE RIGHT HERE WITH YOU
Depends on the volume
Take profits and cover the next 3 mortgage payments now

&#x200B;

or take profits later and cover the down payment on a new house
HOLD HOLD HOLD
I‘d take the profit 4figures and up
BELIEVE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Setup a 60 day Stop on quote at whatever is 125% profit for you. If the price falls that low u make 125% guaranteed.  Zero risk while u still stay in to reap the possible reward
Too much momentum right now to sell
Easy. Take 100% and hold the rest.
Sellers go to hell
Stop selling wtf are you doing
WHERE THE SELL?? ONLY UP
RIP to anyone selling right as the squeeze is really starting. See y'all at 50 shortly
#This is class war!
Why Yahoo finance refuse to give $bbby spotlight, it’s not in the most traded, most gainer, or most watched. It’s anywhere
Because crime.
look up who owns Yahoo Finance, hint it's not Yahoo.
Okay guys, do NOT take profit until I do okay. I will let you know guys.
Who bought at 28.04?
You know I did
lol
Guys, repost if you believe that it will reach $100!!!
Wrong social media platform
havnt felt this good since i Bough GME at 440
Those were fun times actually.  I bought in at $420 (put in a stop loss for $419)  Watched it bounce around for a while and had a blast.  Best $1 I ever spent.
last time I bough for yolo & kicks, now its a sound investment. the ape power is insane
Kicking myself for being stopped out at 9.85$. Trying to play it safe was fucking RETARDED… 🤦‍♂️
You started thinking like a smart person. That is the opposite of retarded mate. That is your problem
true. tried to be a smart retard. just stupid…
Hindsight is always 20/20
aaaaand i brought the peak.... welp
peak hasnt even been touched yet, no worries
That peak will soon be the trough
In with 2k... Not much But it's with Lots of Love 🥰 do we have a Goal?
2k into 20k
Yes. The total meltdown of the global financial system.
$80!! Or higher
Where the fuck do you guys come from where 2k shares at $19 isn't a lot wtf
I yoloed for 7,145 shares between $14-$15. Compared to some people that still isn't a lot. I also think they meant they put in 2k worth of money, not shares.
2k € Not 2k shares 🥲
Pretty sure it's 2k moneys
Great 😎 so hold IT IS.
Just Halted at $28 isnt this illegal??? 😂😂😂
No its a normal halt
[deleted]
ok if u say so
Circuit breaker. It went up too fast too soon. 

It’s a built in mechanism that works up and down. 

Give it 20 minutes and the rocket keeps fueling.
ok if u say sooo
Literally bought a $300 put like a hour ago on BBY and it’s already worthless lmfao
I respect your balls, king.
I doubled down and bought another $900 worth of Puts
Betting against Apes…
You got what u deserve
HALTED! WTF? (edit) AGAIN!

I do, and it is obvious they halted trading so the Hedgies could sell, look at the volume and the timing. It'll however brreak the $30s in about an hour. It'll be lunch-time lull pretty soon. Buy buy buy.
A security is automatically halted when it moves >10% in <15 minutes. It’s not some conspiracy. Unless the buy or sell buttons are taken away.
Cn't reply autoMOD is looking at me funny! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
FUCKING HOLD YOU FUCKS
FUCKING HEDGIES
fuk GME also halted! along with BBBY and both momentums killed
Dear Regulators,

please stop manipulating market,

thanks!

Your Michel
DO NOT sell rn ppl
panic sold but it won’t let me buy ☹️
WE NEED ELON 🦍🦍🦍
Second
We ain’t seeing 15 again
I am levered to the tits on this
I like the stock
So here we go again. Remember the last time:

-	buy stocks not options
-	don’t set stop losses because of ladder attacks (lol how I missed them)
-	1hr before market close = power hour
-	💎✋
-	what else did I miss?
Why stocks not options?
I mean of course you can buy options but buying stocks pushes the squeeze (stocks are needed to cover => less stocks available => price goes up)
[removed]
The Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. We like Columbus out here now.
I'm getting scared
fr this is a nail biter but im throwing another 100 in its all i can afford
I just bought 20strike calls for Friday on the dip...lol I'm retarded.
Almost every issued share traded within 1 hour of market open 😂😂😂😂
And you get an IOU! And you get an IOU!
How high did gmes volume go during the sneeze?
I believe it was over 700 million three days in a row back in January 2021. Billions of shares were traded in a few short weeks.
Just bought january 20$ calls. Fuck it cause why not
How much you pay??? IV gotta be nuts on those. Will still pay off tho
Whats IV?
At this rate my position in BBBY will be larger than my one in GME
This play is going to make me a xx,xxx GME hodler
Just exercised 6 of my $11.50 call options. Scaling in as price jumps to fuck whoever sold them to me at   0.88
Asshole who posted this bullshit is short BBBY. Fuckim
*DUFFMAN VOICE*

&#x200B;

OOOOOOHHHHH YEAHHHHHHHHH
I want to buy more but momma I'm just still so scared.... from last time.
This is the dip

#BUY IT
Sold my calls ending this week for a nice $1200 gain…. Only down $3400 all time now. I’m jumping back in to BBBY for longer calls
I sold half my long calls and bought Friday calls lol
Hope it pays off for you. I really wanted to hold longer but I got baby hands 🙌
buy shares not calls
God dammit stay in 20!!
TD has restricted me from buying more BBBY. This means it's working!!
TD sucks balls
TD sucks balls
TD sucks balls
TD sucks balls
TD sucks balls
Bought 200shares this morning at 16 then 200 more shares at 20 …. Go tell everyone to buy and hold !!!! We are going to squeeze those short sellers
Stop spamming numb nuts
What is happening when we all put our shares for sell at 1000k?
Where were going we dont need roads
Sigh.  Goddammit.  Here we go.  When GME ran up, "apes" were talking about share prices hitting $100K+ each.  It went to $450 or so (a very, very impressive run) and then pulled way back.  Now that BBBY went up a few bucks in the past week, we have to see these kinds of posts again...
 Apes selling AMC and buying more BBBY. This is going to be a $$$ run. HODL HODL
False. Real apes buying both
Thats what I did!
Buy Moreeeee
What are the shorts gonna do they have family too :( LOL
nice I hit my target - turning a few hundred dollars into rent money. I am bowing out, I will be cheering you apes from the sideline!
Congrats bro on the gainz
I had 300 shares @ 11, bought 200 more yesterday at 14, holy fuck shit we’re at 25. Damn do I just drop another $10K??? @ me bro
DCA this mother fucker!
Sell off my Tesla for this?
ITS HALTED WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
it hit the halt threshold, moved to much too fast
Trading halted WTF
Well, what did you expect
Give it 3 more minutes
What do we do now?!
Guys the halt is the same tactics they used on gme as well. They halted 5 times a day. They will try to short it.
Do not sell and get to the moon
halting isn't tactics. it's how the market operates. "Circuit breakers halt trading on the nation's stock markets during dramatic drops and are set at 7%, 13%, and 20% of the closing price for the previous day. The circuit breakers are calculated daily."
BUY!!!! HODL Were fucking the government
Um do I sell now or keep on hodling? 😂
literally the same thing is happening what was with gme

&#x200B;

it actually proved that this shit is going to the moon
How are they able to short better after Halts?

buy as soon as it opens
Once that buy button becomes back u buy
LOL, they struggling to control BBBY and GME at the same time.
The are on a shit seesaw
What the fuck is up with this halting
It’s automatic
It’s normal when a stock rises or drops 10% in less than 5 mins I think
lol, the borrow is still at 54%, probably wont come down until shorts are hauled out on stretchers at Cohen's strike price (60). lmfao
shorts r fuk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

I’ll be honest. I expected red today and buy more on dip. This is splendid
Same. Thought we’d have a repeat after the last FOMO Monday
Same here
#halt 2.0 on it's way!
GME & BBBY MEGATHREAD, MODS? <3
THEY ONLY HALT IF THEY CANT AFFORD IT, LETS FUCKING GOOO
BUY BUY BUY! 🚀🚀🚀
Can you imagine this actually hitting $30 today??  lol.  the world is dumb
Let’s get that DAILY VOLUME UP TO 300mil FUCK THE HEDGE FUNDS
Riding 100 shares @$10 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
lol, if I had bought a bunch of $8 BBBY 8/26 calls for .10 each back on 7/26 instead of same week 5.5s for .10 I would have made $200k today instead of having them expire worthless.
Lost a lot of money from amc, bbby is my only chance, HELP ME
Yawn, come get me when bbby is over 100, cuz I still won’t be selling
Wow if we break $28 this will actually explode.  I seriously bet if we pass $28 it hits $35 EOD.
high was 28.60
And it would have done it w/o the halt.  If he hit $28 again they can't halt it again so I believe we'll plow through this time.
And then once it crosses 45 its game over.  There's like 40k+ calls and I'm sure it's probably double that by now
Let’s break 28!!! And shatter that halt level
So many calls waiting to be exercised at 30. This is a power keg.
Ryan Cohens the match
What's the sell wall looking like?
Just wait till $45…..
Power Kegel
I am enjoying myself. I’m going to bed bath tonight and having sex with a hooker on a bed display. Then smacking the manager and telling her I own this place!!

Cheers man :)
Yup, just read that on RH. They're like someone who isn't us halted trading of BBBY... Fucking shit....

Not at all put $500 in 20 min ago and up 10%
Never
Forget GameStop this is HKD 2.0

We’re going up even after 2 halts. You’re right!
Nah, what they are doing is not just silly manipulation of the market psychology to save their hedgefund buddies, no no, it's good serious regulation
Stop with selling/take profits,  just buy and hold for a few weeks. Close the broker app if can help stay calm
The volume is glorious. The media and their FUD can go fuck themselves with their $1 predictions. Not selling until $25, and I'll only be selling enough to exercise my calls.
25 isn't the target! Just hold if you can
Lol I want to exercise the calls instead of selling them. They're ITM rn and they expire next week. I need cash, and I think 20 individual shares sold to buy 100 shares is more helpful to the squeeze. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Ok then,  but now it's better to have all the shares for the squeeze
🤌🏻🤌🏼🤌🏽🤌🏾🤌🏿 no cash to deploy
Ok now I'm greedy... Fly little bitchbby
Just bought $500 more
I’m in. Let’s fucking go. 🦍🦧🦍🦧
Sold more cover calls at 45 next Friday,  used the premiums to buy more shares @$ 19.20
Double bottom now let’s double
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH
11 share lol I just started trading
Break $20! Let’s get to $25!
The volume since yesterday is unlike the trend we saw in GME.
In a good way or bad way?  I can’t remember back that far.
Based on the trend, the volume should have been similar as Friday, around 80M.
the volume for bbby is infuckingsane is what hes saying
[removed]
Price trend is close. Check the volume trend. I am not talking about absolute value.
Fuck put me in coach! What number do we need to hit and for how long to make some hedgies cry?!
LETS GO MOTHER FUCKERS WE'RE NOT DONE YET. HOLD THAT FUCKING SHIT AND BUY MORE YOU REGARDED IDIOTS. I LOVE YOU ALL!
Ryan Cohen V. Adam Aaron Wrestlemania XXV. ORDER NOW ON PPV!
It’s pushin pushin lol. One day there will be a rug pull but today is not that day
Yes, I think this run will last longer than a day.
It’s already lasted all month basically
Reminder that the all time high of bbby is in the 70s, but not after this week 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
why would someone sell at 20$ when we know what happened last time a stock was shorted this much? this could very well touch 300$
$7B in revenues and 1.5B mkt cap do the math it's still a bargain.
can't wait until BBBY implodes the entire market and hedgies start going tits up again, anyone short BBBY is long ROPE at this point
BUY BUY BUY DO NOT SELL SELL SELL

Do I buy calls
No IV is too crazy buy shares.
Ok I have 44 @ 9.66 all I can afford I’ll just keep that
Shares and hodl
clearly you guys weren't here when GME was jumping $20 every second , it was crazier than this
I would like to revise my earlier price target from $30 before end of the week to $30 by COB tomorrow. That is all.
ITS WORKING! Don’t let the shorts buy back in lol!
Hey guys I think BBBY may be a little bullish, what do you think?

Captain Halt is not amused with your query.
I paperhanded at 20% gains... good luck to you bros still in it. I don't have the balls (or settled funds) to risk becoming a bagholder at these prices.
You won't be sorry. I sold a couple calls to cover the cost of my options. Hurts seeing it go up more but discipline is the way
That's why you buy calls
IMAGINE SELLING AT 30 LOL
Imagine selling
The squeeze is on BOOOOYYYYS
Prepare for a large dip after the half
Agreed. Happened a lot with GME. Set your limit buys now for the dip
holy gme
HALTED
Why'd the wazzocks halt trading? Massively green at least though.
What does Trading halted imply?!
Moon beyond all moons
Circuit breaker to reduce volatility
no implications, its automatic when there is 10% movement in less than 5 minutes. Means it is volatile right now
Brought 4 shares, not much but let's see where $100 takes me.
Here comes the paperhand brigade
Why do they hate the moon mission? We were going up so quick
this isnt over yet. Was the halt due to the SEC or what
75% -> 55 % and i dont even flintch
BuyBuyBuyYolo
If you’re in for less than $75 a share then congratulations you’re early af.
Bought cheap option expiring friday now up 500%...to 40 dollars.

Weird ride to be on.
Yeeee same here brother. Did you close off to roll over/buy stock?
Well that was a fun pair of halts. Time to buy some calls.
Shares u goose
Halt after halt, theyre so fucking scared
Have they actually halted buys? Wtf?

Probably LULD.
I'm guessing it's a glitch, but RN robinhood is showing the $45 calls worth 1 cent
Fuck....
I have $45c
Praying for you brother
They’re worth $1.03 now
You mean 1.40? Lol this shit is insane
It is, the bids all dropped off the market for a second, post halt they will come back.
yea my calls are worthless yet market says 2.20 for 32c
EVERYONE HODL DONT BE A COWARD
All I see is a discount
WTF IS THAT BID ASK SPREAD LMAO
Shits wil'in out
GME GOING BALLISTIC🚀
Its gonna go down more. Same shit happened with gme. Just be patient
L3ZZZ GO BACK ONNN
They halted... IM BULLISH. Bought 20,000 shares just now!
Nice to see that $4 DROP SO i COULD BUY MORE FOR LESS!
Can’t keep a good stonk down
How is it still going up?
Fking bullshit that's it's legal for the hedgies to do whatever they want, but when anyone else attempts their shista ways "must freeze trading of this asset"
It's for 'our protection' 

aww how sweet of them looking out for the little guy

hold fuckers
Uhhh uhhh ahh Ahh ! Monkeys with Money together stronk!
Thank you retards for the profits I am an APE
if it takes out that 27 position expect 30. if you arent in this you are guna regret it.
some exchanges have stopped trading of BBBY?? GME repeats!
Who has? Still on 212
This is false.
Source?
EAT MY SHINY METAL SHARES
Theyre trying to distract by moving other meme stocks up.


ONLY BBBY RIGHT NOW


ALLLLL INNNNNNNNN BBBY
my 40 & 80 calls for jan23 are currently up approx. 11x. Love RC
DeGiro is blocking europoors from buying. m-Fökers
You sure? I'm on Degiro and buying and selling. What you seeing?
Getting message “price to high (in relation to open), maximum price 20.80”
Is that when you're trying to do a market sell? Yeah you'll see that on a market sell if you are trying to spend most of you're money. Do a limit buy. If you don't know how to do that, just go to "Limit" on the "Buy" page, then put a price slightly under the current price, the number of shares you want, and it will Auto calculate how many you get for that price, and you just get as many as you have the funds for. :)
thanks for the instructions:) but I never do a market buy, always limit. Even reducing the size, doesn’t work. Maybe it’s my account type or something 🤷‍♂️
Oh, weird. Maybe they have closed down buys, I don't know. I'm all in BBBY so I can't try to buy.
yeah, it’s probably their version of disabling the buy button without actually disabling it
Only other thing I can suggest is that there's a BBBY EUR from Tradegate and a US one on NASDAQ, if one doesn't work maybe the other will.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Let’s get regarded in here!
BOOOOOOOM 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Diamond hands, and we gonna´ moon ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
I feel like a cuck for buying shares instead of calls. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
I’m in shares too mate. Been burned too many times by calls when idk what tf I’m doing. Green is green
Bro I don’t even really know the difference
The IV has been insane the past cpl days so premiums are nuts, i wouldnt feel too bad as most call buyers are going to get blown out by IV crush as soon as the volume drops.  It almost doesnt matter where the stock price is at that point
From what I’ve read on here, shares help more than calls anyway :)
It’s flying lmfaooooo 300 shares here
Im all in
alright fine maybe I'll buy some 8/19 30s
20 incoming. BBBY go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

500 left to buy scraps later
HOLY MOLY
Just buy and hold. Repeat that as much you can and you are willing to wait and then take the huge profit (i suggest at least 200+ dollars)
i just applied for a 10k loan to start a business
Let's Goooooooooooo!  🚀🚀🚀
I've made way more than beer money at this point

BBBY to 100 by Friday please

Bruh
Catching up amc

For my own edification, can anyone explain what a "short ladder attack" is?
When hedge funds trade back and forth the stock and a price that is a % less than current price. Simulates that their is selling pressure
Those motherfuckers! So basically inverse wash trading, but *technically* not illegal because there's more than one firm involved in the swaps? Oh-ho-oh I am so going to enjoy making them bleed! Thank you for the education, kind sir.
Yes. That's what they do and the can trade prices with many decimals so it doesn't cost them

lol. and now GME shot up and immediately halted. MOON BABY.
WE BACK
back on!
I've been trying to buy dips today and managed to get in on one at 18.86 with 20 stocks. Since then, it's barely dropping 0.5 points before going up another 1 or 2. Buy more at 28?
Bought 50 at 26.93. Yeehaw
And another 20 at 25.40. Should have reversed that
Same dilemma. Was not expecting this type of action so quickly, it’s like GME on crack
Everybody get the fuck in here
WE BACK BOYS!!
Pain!! I sold my 30$ calls for a loss on Friday. Atleast I’m still holding shares 😢

edit: it’s back. keep it going! this is only the beginning! ape banana rocket moon!
I’m not even sure it’s gonna be able to dip after this halt lol

yep, youd buy 400 shares at 14 per share
you're an idiot. 1000 shares per call. do your math again and make sure you have towels ready

edit: I'm the idiot. I read "make" instead of "take"

I love you guys 💕

Paper hands
Hehe! 😉 yea he is!
I missed the train on GMC AND AMC. Not about to miss it again for BBBY
come back down bobby, I'll get some more of you bbby
Good day, my fellow betting addicts, this is the kangaroo gang with yet another p&d.

Now that we are in war, what is the best way to end it? I am sure you can recognize that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to end this: We can put forward indiscriminate and immediate bull buy orders with unlimited leverage to precipitate a short withdrawal at the lowest levels. Or we can just persist with a never ending stonk hodl mentality, if necessary - through the ape way, which delivers high iv on the regular. Win-win scenario. So, why not both?

Let us therefore unite as a nation in a firm and wise policy of real autism–not the autism of porn loss, but autism with honor–not just to fuck looming gay bears in our time, but for generational tendies to come.

We meet here at a time of great mental and economic challenges, sort of meaning great opportunities for most degenerate investors. We meet at a time when we face great uncertainty at home and abroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a worldwide retarded nation, however, we meet also at a time when that fiber has been tested and it has proved itself strong as a diamond. 

Today, as always in our history, we can base our confidence on what any wife's boyfriend will achieve in the future with the record of what those same wife's boyfriends have achieved in the past just to avoid any position around a Wendy's parking lot.

It is never too late to be a retard, choose BBBY, fuck the sigma hedge fucks fud, kysfags.
I’m grabbing the short bus, everyone pile in
You're going short???? Never!
You didn’t ride the short bus to school? Too smart for us here
I had to Google it, I'm not from the U.S. lol. 

I'm definitely on the short bus. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Y’all I’m sorry I went paper hands, my account worth 1.1K and profit was 150 😔😔 I’m a broke college student I’ll still help to pump if I can
Gotta look out for #1 my man, only take the risks you can handle.

Maybe throw that 150 back in doh ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)
BBBY can go very high, $200 max I think. Of course, it can go up to 300-350, since I don't have information about many things. It will definitely go up to 60-80. So is even a $30 BBBY expensive? NO! ;)
28.04 lock? What's happening?
Halted
Volatility HAULT. LFG!!
Yo wtf why is is dropping to $23
So u can buy more ofc.
Short selling
Hold you fucks
Bbby halted? 
 Gme i gotchu fam * starts pumping*
You guys that religiously say “they are trying to ____” and “THEY halted again ____” sound like class A fucking retards.
Literally zero fucking idea what they are talking about, and I'm a fucking moron.
~3x the float has already traded today... Those damn retail day traders can't make up their minds they just keep selling high and then buying the dip.
Ok, so they halted just long enough to allow Wallstreet to sell their puts, and we could only watch our money fall to the 23 dollar range. I see now. I feel real bad for the robinhood traders back when gme was halted for the rich people to do whatever with OUR MONEY!!!!!!
They this is criminal
how is this not fucking manipulation? free market my fucking ass. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
Take your BBBY profits to >!BBBY!< 🤫…. It’s the next BBBY
If I buy a $25 call option expiring on Friday, can you sell it before it reaches $25 while you’re still profiting? Or must you wait til it reaches past the $25 mark to sell?
Yes noob
nice, the normies are piling in. we're FUCKIN RICH BOIS
You can sell at any time, but it will obviously be worth much more if you hold past $25.
If you buy it, you can sell at any point before expiration. Doesn't matter if it hits the strike or not.

You need to practice with cheap options before getting into this. Look for something with a reasonably high open interest and a low price.
Gonna study up first before throwing much around, but figured it couldn’t hurt to ask the crew here.
Sell whenever
You can sell at any time
What does "sell" mean?
If you get it for free ya
you can sell it 4 seconds after you buy it
You can sell it to someone else before then
you can definitely sell but I wouldn't
Honestly dawg do not buy options on this the implied volatility is gonna fuck you up and you’re better off with shares
Please don’t buy options if you don’t even understand the basics! Just buy the stock and hold
selling is for the weak minded
You clearly don't understand how options work. I would not fuck with options unless you understand them. They WILL fuck you over
Solid advice, but that’s why I ask. Wanna understand before playing much
There's some great YouTube tutorials on options. I'd watch those
Thank you
If you’re in the money with your call at expiration, does it automatically sell upon expiration giving you the profit, or do you actively have to sell it to receive the profit?
if it hits 50 im going to put a pipe bomb in my ass and run into the nyse
Proof or ban
this is why i come here.
everyone remember this!
Mods? RemindME! 7 hours
Never before have I woke up, bought back into something while taking a shit, showered, ate breakfast, then flipped it for 60% profit. Fucking madhouse.
sold at 21 doubling profit then dropped it straight back in
This is the way
Popping my gambling virginity on BBBY.  Bought 51 shares at $17.25.

Determined to turn this $1000 I can afford to lose into -$200k I can't.

I wanna see $25 by EOD.  LET'S GO!
Do you think it's gonna hit 25?
Yes. If not today, then fo sho tomorrow
California needs to wake the fuck up.
I’m so proud of you. I keep buying and raising my average. 600 shares at $12.25
It’s moving in the wrong damn direction
Haven’t been in since GME, in for 37 shares at $15.67 this morning. Going to buy more when it dips 💎💎
You think I can quit my job off 112 shares? They tryna make me come back into the office.

P.S Somebody make a meme too kendrick Lamar GOD from the DAMN album for bbby
These fagots Halting my stock
#HKD was capital for for BBBY....prove me wrong
Please don't hit my trailing stop order!  The halt killed momentum
Lol bought puts right after the halt, making money on the up and down
On our way to 30 nothing stopping this
WE HOLD UNTIL THERE IS NO BUY BUTTON,  THEN WE ALL SELL!
Cohen for President!!!   “The Money Party”.
Skip 18 straight to $20!
[deleted]
me too!
Too
Listen the OTM calls I bought weren't supposed to go ITM. Can y'all chill?
Jesus I did so much profit in the last days I see the 80$ on the stock coming.  Gonna go all in now
Soon may the tendieman come… 🚀🚀
Where is everybody looking at the trade volume? How do I see that?
Seriously??
They obviously don’t know, so just tell them lmao.
Can't lol don't know what broker he's on
Depending on what you’re looking at to see the price action, there will always be somewhere there that shows the “volume”
I found it! It's in small text in the top right corner on WeBull
What broker are you on?
WeBull
Oh I see it now!
This won't be over today right? I'm an idiot an my account flagged as patterned day trading way back when I first started. I exercised my calls today so I can't sell till tomorrow, but I'm gonna be so mad if this hits triple digits today
It's definitely not hitting triple digits today. If it's going to do that, it'll take another week at least. The bigger concern is that this is the top. But hey, if folks like you are exercising those calls, hopefully that won't be the case.
If it hits Triple Digits today, I'll fuck a cactus in a bathtub full of rubbing alcohol
I finally bought so now it's gonna crash...
Im gonna fucking loose money i bought just before 20 on leverage
Bruh it’s been 10 minutes. Patience. Smoke a joint, kick up your feet, make a drink and breathe brother.
Anything under 20 is a steal
Actually the first good deal I've done. Sold off 35% which was my initial cost. My other 25 (whale alert) is now just pure profit.
Does anyone know the percentage shorted?
47.21% fellow bobby naught
Fuuuck
mucho
We're fucking flying, brether
Where we stopping next $22 ?
FUCK IT WE BUY HIGH SELL LOW EXTRA 60 SHARES AT 20 BUCK LETS FUCKIGN DO IT
Why doesn’t BBBY get halted on the way up?

Good bot
This is an investment recommendation. Past performance = future returns
I will deadass post a vid of me eating an entire watermelon on my tik tok if it closes over $22 today
Might as well skip lunch
Might as well skip lunch
Fuck put me in coach! What number do we need to hit and for how long to make some hedgies cry?!
No one has ever gone broke taking profits but damn I wish I’d waited one more day lol
$25 Target today minimum, If that holds we are shooting ropes way past $30 BBBYs
TD has restricted me from buying more BBBY. This means it's working apes!!
Another one I missed out on. Didn’t believe Kodak years ago. Missed it. Missed GMC. Missed AMC. What’s next 🥹
Your wife’s womb
shut up it’s literally $420 EOW
It’s not over though….
 it’s literally $420 EOW
Not too late
You haven't missed until the previous ATH is a flat line at the bottom of the graph
You haven't missed out until the previous ATH is a flat line at the bottom of the graph
You haven't missed out.
Didn’t miss GME. At all. She’s still coiled tighter than a nuns asshole.
We are clearing $30 today. News media exposure starts.. we will see $1000 soon. Trust.
$10k end of year yolo fuck it, remove sell button
Bought 200shares this morning at 16 then 200 more shares at 20 …. Go tell everyone to buy and hold !!!! We are going to squeeze those short sellers
what platform did u buy it on?
My only regret is not buying at 15.85 at market open with money I got from selling my gf and kidneys
I want to buy this again at $400, can we please do the bare minimum?
I FUCKING LOVE YOU ALL ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
holy moly
I've never exercised an option, if i exercise my $12c, do i need money in my account to do that or will it just use the money my call can earn me to buy me the 100 shares?
You need the money…so $1200, the option is currently intrinsically worth $2200 so you make at least $1000 if you exercise now
Ah ok ty, cause my call is worth 1100 so i thought it would just ask for the remaining 100 lol
You have to buy 100 shares at $12 so $1200, if you sold 100 shares now its $2300 so youd make 1100
lol you belong here. Holy hell
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Call your broker?
Usually the brokerage will automatically buy in the money options at the end of the trading day for a small fee if you don’t have the money to exercise them
Just bought 5 more hodllllll!!!!
such a regard, got in at $23.40 :/
We are coming back for u dont worry
I am also highly regarded
just hold
BABBY YA BLOODY BEAUTY TAKE MY MONEY

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Only halts when a 10% or more move occurs in under 5 minutes I believe
Kapow. There it is
Lol right? Shows you who they’re scared of…

Which makes me wonder if there’s any longevity to this. Or did they halt GME just because they’re THAT much more ensnared by it?
I mean, its automated.
Ah. Ok. Am dumb, ty
But then, look at gme the second bbby halted. What a web eh
That’s true… up $12? We can wait. Up $3? Whoaaaaa there partner
The fuck is just happening ?
It’s halted. Happens. Give it 5 minutes and it will open again. Pretty common for any stock rocketing like this.
Halted?

Go read a bit
Gme halted
You bastard WS (WallStreet) stopped it... you will have to answer for that too!
lol now GME halted
Are people really bailing at $28 wtf?
Guys don't sweat the halt in trading.  Use this time to transfer money to your brokerage accounts and get ready for when it resumes. Another big push!  Im going to be in another 5k.  I've never put so much on a single stock! I'm a fucking BBBY believer!
SHORT LADDER ATTACK

[deleted]
yup one last giant pump by the hedgecunts, halt it, then put algo's on overdrive when unhalted to crash it down
No
Why would anyone sell now?? :D Yo.. if this volatility is too much for you, you're in the wrong place. DIAMOND HANDS!!!
MOASS with GME at the same time? imagine if a bunch of fucking nerds on the internet break the market
UNPAUSED, WE'RE GOING BACK UP! HOLD!!!
Death the SHFs. Lets burn those fuckers down.
Last chance to buy dip!!!
Back from the dead Bobby
🌈🌈🌈🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
Wtf? My GME popped during the halt. Still bought more BBBY
Can someone explain why the hell it freezes like that?
Halts. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp
Thank you for the info.
market halt
volatility halt
It's a halt, used to control volatility
LULD (or LUDP) pause

it's a circuit breaker. normal. google it
Probably hedgefunds dumping large amounts of shares. It fills a ton of orders at once and so it freezes to clear and then reset the ledger.
I’m not a expert but I believe to try and stop the stock from crashing or rising a crazy amount
When there is to much volume and transactions in the market with a stock. It will automatically be halted from time to time
Volatility halt. Spikes or drops too far too quickly and they pause all trades.
Profit is profit.
Yupp!
Just bought another $5000 and that's my entire play money account.  Lets go apes!
What colour lambo are you getting?
Green
sorry apes but this shit gives me the same feeling as betting.. I like it too much, im out. Mental health is important. fucking riding this adrenaline all day tho
They halted trade
It’s unhalted now
Can’t buy on Robbing Hood
yes you can?
The button was just solid green when I was in. About 5 min after this post it changed back.
52 week high gonna get raped soon
sold for £400 profit, put back in all my profit and initial at 25!
God Damn Feelin Blessed On My Way UP, Young Muthafucker trying to get ur pay up, SLeeep When ya Dead, Bitch Im tryin to Stay Up, 

BBY <3
Volume will hit 1b
WE NEED TO HIT 7B EVERYONE ON EARTH WILL TRADE 1 SHARE OF BBBY
Good job you guys stick in it at least until EOD!!
EOM retard!
I SOLD ALL MY GME FOR BBY. I WANT BACK IN
Why? GME is pumping alongside it.
I sold it just before the pump unfortunately because I've been holding for a year or so thinking wont hurt to buy back in next payday lol
Lol I know the feeling. I want to sell so bad sometimes, but I just slap myself and hold. Price is too unpredictable to know where it will go and when.
I'm out if the loop on BBBY. Could someone tell me what the end price is expected to be?
$420.69
👆🏾
Honestly I think 80-90
Interesting. Thank you!
RC has a 2023 Jan $80 strike price. Also look at the monthly MACD. It just crossed over from the bottom
Strike prices from 50-80
$420.69
$80 minimum according to the great prophet ryan cohen
Beyond
Yes.
i don’t have any positions but remember to take profits fellas. this can become an echo chamber real quickly with people throwing unrealistic numbers out and before you know it rugs are pulled. congrats boys get that bag
Are you fucking kidding me
I went from up $900 to down $20. WTF. Fuck you shitadel capital.
Hold ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
on your calls? on of my calls went +$800...after the halt it's not worth $1 lol wtf
Odd that GME popped during the halt almost like they want our attention somewhere else 🤷‍♂️
First
What is realistic price for this? How high can it go? I’m fairly new to stocks but I put some money in with alll the hype
$420
If I knew the answer to that question I wouldn’t be here ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
nobody knows
Market cap is only 1.3 billion right now.

That's nothing.  

GME got pumped up to 22 billion.  

If this only ends up being 1/2 of the GME squeeze, we're still looking at a potential stock price of like $200.
RC has it pegged at $80
No one knows. There’s no math to figure that out. It’s based on when people get greedy and begin to take their winnings.
yes
I wonder when the shorts will start to cover!! This is amazing
Ahh yes up 300% in less than a month. There’s gonna be a lot of bag holders. Lmao
up 240%...think i will hold a bit longer
Hahahaha you stupid fucking bears. Better see some loss porn from you retards
my stop loss was triggered at 9$![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Unloaded 30c RIGHT before the halt. Thank god
Hahahahahaah fuck the SEC. Are you fucking kidding me they’re doing this bullshit again?
While BBBY is halted switch over to GME lol
Now both halted lol hedgies fucked
Fucking SEC bullshit.  Quit acting like halting buying is gonna make people think the market is not rigged.
yo that shit dropped quick wtf
Trading halted globally nobody could buy
Sus trading halts into dips, they’re out of tricks it’s the same play book from the first January
lol shorts woke up
How are halts legal?

So why are they allowed to halt exchanges for bbby? Seems kind of rigged.
It’s a volatility halt you fucking retard
Why must I be so regarded…
Wonderful, more noobs that don’t understand halts.  “itS mAnipUlaTiOn”
I mean, halting IS manipulation.
I heavily suggest some research before trading stocks.
The purpose of halting is to change the behaviour of the market. That is to say, manipulate the behaviour of the market.
Please back to $28+ Please. Sorry I'm new, can't take this stress.
Hold the line doobie
First time? Huh
We’re going to $35-40 today
$50 EOD is not a meme
LeTS FuK tHesE HeGgIeS
Sold all for massive gains right before the halt. Bought it back after and missed about $2k in losses. To the MOON
$300 in the next hour.
there’s like 100,00 on this thread, if everyone buys like 100share - that’s like 10mil share, just on one day, it will make some movements !!!0
#this is how bagholders are made
GTFO WITH THAT NEGATIVITY AND GO BUY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUNDS
I bought calls I’m sorry
buy more i bet they hold it steady for a couple hours before another leg up
So... bought at 10.50. But kind of want to put more into it. Is it too late? Mid 20s can be the real squeeze tho
Moar

CONVINCE ME TO NOT STOP LOSS
YOU WILL REGRET WHEN WE HIT 100$
GODAMMIT HANDS TURN DIAMOND
Convince me you don’t hate money. This is a shit test to shake the paper hands
HALP I CAN'T SEE THE DIAMONDS
My wife told me to "leave it" which is wifespeak for HODL so I've been given spousal permission. Good thing I married a girl with diamond hands!
DON'T BUY GME YOU REGARDS!! HEDGIES ARE TRYING TO SPLIT OUR EFFORRTS
BUY BOTH!
BBBY ONLYY!! FOCUS YOUR EFFORTS
I paper handed yesterday, but I ain't mad. Don't let perfection distract you from good.
Time to buy back in at a loss!
Sold 100 to recoup some losses elsewhere, still holding 111 bought at 9.60
Your FOMO is weak.
No wonder you have losses then😂
Panic sold a few times to buy back at a higher price. Gonna try holding stronger this time, c'mon guys, need a new place to live!
Lol gme and amc apes are abandoning their stock and join this one.
Nobody’s is leaving GME lol
We really aren’t… nice try though. I’d venture a guess that people in GME or AMC would snipe a quick profit this week on BBBY and send those gains into their own long term holds.
Got that right 👏🏻
Gme apes are pretty solid. I see amc boys doing this. I own neither ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Trump voice: “wrong”
Nice sell off dipshits
I should have sold when I had the profit. FUCK YOU YOU HEDGE FUCKS
Don’t be a bitch
I know it sounds like conspiracy but I predicted that the most popular coin would drop hard if BBBY rallied and it did. I’m Glad I sold my miner positions yesterday. Btw the same thing happened when GME rallied
Is there a reason why that’s connected?
People speculate that hedge funds are selling their coin to cover their shorts
I hope we get this to the moon!! I'm in
Squeeze squooze
Spy is panicking

And to think I hedged my shares a bit with selling waaaaay otm calls… 🤣
Going to go balls shares. Guys the calls
May not be a good idea unless it’s 60+ strike. But!!!! The shares can 10x,20x from here. Is it too late? No it’s just getting started bros!!!!! LETS FUCKING RIDE
Time to buy a little more
Sell everything else and load up on BBBY
Is it too late to get in???
Bro the Rocket is getting started at 20$ 🚀🚀
It's still in the teens, get in before 20's
Get it now before we get to triple digits

Only too late at 69.69
Yes
No.  Don’t miss the bus.  Just getting started
THERE GOES 21

Up calls. down puts

$22 incoming.... This is nuts. So glad I got in but when will it end?????
These bastards better not try to turn off the buy button again
SUCK MY COCK BEARS
Ah shit I sold my calls at $13 yesterday kill me
Not too late to buy more
forgive me for selling my 28 shares at $20. I'll hold my new 48 shares with my life on the line
Lol took profit then fomo’d back in
Finna bust
Long way to go. Keep buying…
Fucking so pissed I dumped my entire fidelity account into bbby but my bank won’t let me transfer more money from my checking to buy more cause it’s a youth account but I’m 18!!!! 😡😡😡😡
If it was opened before you were 18, Go into the bank and have them change the account type or open a new checking account.
Fuck it might be over by the time I do that though
So, what's goin on guys? There's been over 4000 comments since I made a run to Taco Bell. \*looks at ticker\* OMG!
No fucking chance my super far OTM 32c that I bought for shits and giggles go itm
Hey guys i just bought in so here comes the dip, sorry
Buying the highest strike calls causes the market makers to have to buy more shares to hedge their position. Load the boat with high strike calls!
They’re starting to halt trades!!!
it HALTED NOOOOOO
Halts are bullshit
You can’t stop me!
Revolut blocked buying/selling $BBBY
Did tdameritrade just block bbby?

Market manipulation is back

WHAT, GME OUTTA NOWHERE
I’m out after 600% profit, the real fomo is happening live in front of our eyes
Being halted is a good thing. Now is the time to double down.

Don’t paper hand!
Halted is not a good thing lol it kills momentum. Like it just did.
No, paper handing kills momentum. Just like GME, if people hold tight through a halt then you get multiple halts as you sky rocket.

It means we are winning.
Really? Cause the halt was at $28 and it’s down to $23. That halt killed momentum.
Okay then sell moron and we will see you at eow

Short sighted
HOLY MOLY
Coming down now... I hate these hedgies
Down means buy more
They did this to scare you into selling.
All in. They’re trying to make it go down. Fuck em
Why we falling
paper hands providing a discount, nice
Them halts don’t scare me. Gives me time to wank a quick one
Buy and hold 🦧
NOOOOOOOOO
I need this in my life

Best ask is .40 cents lmao wtf
We jumpin to gme or
How long will the halt last
5 min

Bullshit were halted an their trading on run up bbby was above average $35 on the first halt
Same fund that bought into BBBY bought GME? Looks that way
ITS OPEN AGAIN LETS BUY BUY BUY
NO PAPERHANDING
APES STRONGER THAN THEY THOUGHT

HAHAHAHA YEAAAAH
If you thought you missed out nows the chance to buy before the next run
Buy button is off ????
Zoom out nerds this happens all the fucking time with meme stocks….. I knew it was going to happen near 30….it was obvious but what is more obvious is it’s rise to beyond
Literally closed put right when it crashes feels bad
Buy buy buy
$APRN halted and dipped at the exact same time as BBBY. Another one with high short interest about to get squeezed
Back at 27$
WAGMI YOLO CALLS YOLO LIFE SAVINGS YOLO BANK LOAN YOLO
Pussies halting trade. Damned
So what’s the target price per share before we sell?
420.69
Lmao. True king shit numbers right there
242.69
Don’t even think about it until $100
Wow. Yea I love the meme answers to this question lol, but I’m also legitimately curious as to what we’re planning the number to be before we all sell. I’m honestly really new to this shit lol.
Good Lord I’m gonna sell EOD and regret it when we push another 20% tokorrow
Then why would you sell??  HODL
Risk aversion tbh.
dip then RIP
Just got in. How much we selling at apes

Hope so
Hell no
No lol relax. Jesus.
Yo that shii dropping
FUUUUCK SHOULD I SELL AND BUY GME? IM SO FUCKING SCAREEEEEEED I WANT MOMMY GME
Tf is GME
The most shorted stock on the planet
Hold all your bananas.
They are trying to divide the BBBY attention with GME, don’t fall for it boys keep up with BBBY
All in one basket
You can’t be serious ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I need some more love with GME tho...
And now the new bbby cult will form once many are left holding the bag
But but... Im still full green from my GME and still holding strong.
This has been repeated over and over again in the past week. Who says the bag holding starts now?
idiot here with options, can't you exercise what you're up without putting up the $ for the full contract?
Idiot without options: isn't excercising simply just purchasing all of them?
Yeah, you buy the shares for whatever price it was when you bought your call. If you don’t have the cash sell the call itself for some gainz
no
Buy shares
bought both already.
considering you an idiot i would advise against exercising your options...typically you just sell the contract
Can someone share actual evidence of a squeeze? Otherwise y’all are just pump and dumping.
Been a half dozen excellent DD posts about the squeeze potential. But that’s entirely irrelevant if your not a true gambler.
Oh, I’m in retardless
[removed]
You’re gonna buy in at $20+ and you know it
Stfu cramer
[deleted]
Just set a limit order for $20. Sorry about the dip
We shall not compare BBBY to GME or HKD. This shit will be on another level. Trust me bro. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Im really starting to think this.
whats happening to my money!?!?!?
Hedgefunds attacking n order to scare us away
In at 15, out at 25! I'm a financial genius. Too bad I only bought 10 shares.
I have TP hands - just sold all my shares 
9.84 cost avg 
24.30 sell avg 

🏌️
No shame in taking profits. Congrats
Buy a round at the bar.
I tp handed the dip last Monday. Bought at 11.60 and sold at 10.10. Making up for it by buying in yesterday morning at 14.24 and holding strong now.
Time to buy puts hahah
This bitch is about to be poor. 👆
If you have a 100% gain on BBBY, please for the love of Cohen take some profits. Feel free to still stay in, but if you don’t take some profits now you never will.
You think I can quit my job off 112 shares? They tryna make me come back into the office.

P.S Somebody make a meme too kendrick Lamar GOD from the DAMN album for bbby
Idk, even if we touch $200 you'd only have $20,000. Sure you could quit, but you would need a new job.
He could always live behind the Wendy's dumpster.
Up like 40% in a purchase I made an hour ago. Should I sell?
No we hold till 200
Hold on there brother
Hodl until valhalla
Take that to r/investing
Hell no, sell when you’re up 40000%
No, it’s not going down anytime soon, look at the buy volume
This is the best play I've ever made. Holy shit
What does halter mean should we sell?
No

What does halted mean is it bad I’m up like 10k from 10k Monday should I sell?
It means to buckle up bucko![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
dont
halted mean that no more trade is allowed
Halted just bc it gained too much to quickly
Go away shill.
How am I a shill asking a question weirdo
Ok, I’ll answer it. If you’ve made 10k and don’t know what a fucking halt is…you’re in the right place.
Noo hold
I didn't think we would get here boys but don't sell until 35 MINIMUM not even just to skim a little profit. The squeeze moons at 35 imo.
I was a bbby bag holder for almost a year at 26 per share. Should I sell now?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Asking for advice here? I’d flip a coin dude, people here be retards. Including me, and you for that matter.
I'm gonna flip a watermelon
As long as it lands on your dick, you're in business
If, it's a lot of shares and you need the money, take at least half off of the table.
About 10k in value. I don't think it's considered a lot here
Some exchanges are halting trading!!!!!!  But not robinhood this time?!

It’s gonna moooooon
Halt has done the trick . people will sell like hot cakes now
Yeah exactly my thinking, puts fear into people
I sold my weekly calls bought 2 hours ago 6 seconds before the halt for 380% profit.

Mhmmmmm thanks?! 👀
Hi, all. 
Im new to this stoxk and in general new to stocs. I bought 100 shares today at 15.65$. 
Now it up by 63%.
When is the time to exit this?
Take profits and run
At 420.69
You’re such a fucking retard
Triple digits
At $300!
$8
When price is triple digits
At whatever you’re comfortable at, lot of ppl are holding because they expect it to rise but, do what you feel is right
Never.
Now or later. Or never. Or yesterday
80
nfa
exit to cover your opening position and gamble with the profits
$69
Hi. I’m new too. But from what I gather you will be highly regarded if you sell at 420.69. But even more highly regarded if you never sell.
Put a 60 day stop on quote sell order 10-15 dollars below the current price. Every time the price rises 5 bucks, raise your quote sale order by 5 bucks. That way you limit your risk or even guarantee profit while still being in. If the stock price goes up to 50, you'd have a stop on quote at 40 so you'd be guaranteed to make almost double what it's at now(27)

You have to manually change your quote number. Super easy to do. On etrade it let's u just click change on your quote order. Go to your old price. Manually type in a new one. Save. Boom done
That’s the thing, you don’t.
I mean honestly if you aren't buying right now did you ever believe in it?
Just bought 500 dollars more during the halt. limit price 25, filled for 23 woooooooo!
Need advise, Have a call on BBBY 8/19 $19, it's over $19 now, when do i sell my call? Don't be mean!!
Now
When you think its on the top.
Exercise it!!!!!
It'll cost you 1900$ to buy the shares... You've already made more than that
Depends on how much you have and your gain, don’t forget to secure capital in this kind of play!
If you think the profits look good right now, sell it any time before 8/19 or it will be sold automatically for you at market close 8/19 for whatever it is worth at that time.

Or you could exercise your option, buy 100 shares at your $19 strike price and hold.

I am a lobster with a keyboard, do not take trading advice from me.
Set up a sell stop order at a price you're comfortable with and rest easy
Wait though... when we get to $50 who is actually going to buy the shares from us so we can all make money...
Shorts
This is the way
The shorts
Short sellers who have to cover. Have you not been paying attention to how much of the stock is shorted? That’s the whole point of this.
Shorts have to
The shortsellers. The market makes. That's the point. They have to buy at whatever the price is
Market makers

bro

market is open
Fuckin Time zones
Have you tried putting in the order as ext? Meaning extended hours. 

If you can't do that, get out of that potatoe you call a brokerage.
Yo did you put a delayed send on this post? Kind regarded
So i get about 30k to put in on thursday... its probably too late by then huh?
i doubt it
No, gme also squeezed over weeks
No, until  at least 40/50 isn't too late if these 30k are legit yours and loans...
I am such a tissue paper hands bitch for selling my 8/19 15c YESTERDAY.
Kicking myself for selling out Monday morning and then rebuying. Scalped myself out of another 5-7k profit and I coulda exercised those ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263) But we FLYING SON ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Volume dying out… 😢
What does it mean for us? nothing to buy anymore? :O
Explain puts and calls to me like I'm a 5 year old.
Money goes in  


????  


Debt comes out
Shut the fuck up and go get sleep
CALL a company on their bs because you think the price is going down or PUT your money where your mouth is because you think it’s going up
money printer.
Call is a bet the price goes up  
Put is a bet the price goes down  


You can buy Calls and Puts from brokers for cash.  You can then sell them at a later date, however you are selling them against the share price at the time of purchase, not the time of sale.    


So if you had calls at $5 and the price is now $30, you can buy a shit loads of shares for $5 a piece instead of 30.  Winner winner no more Wendys for dinner.
Fucking same
shit's going to halt
Bought in at 12.90 for 50, sold it at 16.60, yikes
It's because BBBY got halted so ppl are now rushing madly into GME, AMC, ME, and all other current meme stonks! Insanity!
Timberrrrrr
I sold the top. Waiting to buy the dip. I’m expecting wild as fuck swings
Fuck off hold buy more
GME has plenty of room
My Trailing Stop is 30% below highest. Is that enough?
No, I wouldnt stop loss on these stocks. Just pick a price to sell, or hold. They'll hunt the stoplosses
What prices do you recommend?
for a memestock? absolutely not
No. Get rid of that and just watch and act accordingly like a fucking man.
Stop losses are for pussies
Hey! girls can be Apes too. And I have a a very wet and pretty pussy. 

But on topic, I will change my stop trail to 50% below.
So I know halts trigger on declines, but I’ve never seen a halt on the way up. Is that normal? What’s the rule for that percentage-wise?
You’re fucking retarded
Who’s selling?
Do not shill get out fuckers
[removed]
If I had done this when I was thinking about it last week, I’d already be on the moon
You wouldn't be the first
it was a tough decision but I sold my entire gme position for this..can always buy back in after lol
No Cell No Sell!
I just paperhanded the Fuck out of this stock. Sold it this morning at $17 when I had 8/19 $19C (made 60% profit)..

Someone tell me profit is profit and I’m not dumb
Get fucked grow stronger hands buy in now
Profit is profit and you are not dumb.

Profit is profit. Now use that profit to load back up!
Profit is money, this roller coaster is pure hormonal bliss, you have your $$$ but are missing out of some human experience
You’re not dumb brother, just a puss. 

Edit: I’m sitting on 800% profit and probably won’t sell and eventually lose it all. But I’m winning with that dopamine hit.
You’re fucking dumb
Profit is profit and you’re dumb
profit is profit

but you're still dumb
i sold my 13c aug 19th for fucking cheap, cant have mistakes like that, bought pure fucking stock to become a god
Why doesn’t this sub just pick a monthly stock to pump all at once and just do this multiple times a year
That’s illegal
So?
stfu
pretty sure that would get us all in trouble 😂
Because then we’re just taking money from each other. The aim is to take from the hedge funds who are Locked in and bet the stock will go down. Then when their options go through they’re forced to buy $$$ and then we squeeze. Not as easy as pumping and dumping because you will have people on this thread that lose.
Interesting. I agree fuck the big dogs
That's not how it works.
Cause we’re not in this for the money. There’s a bigger cause young one
Just bagged an easy $700 profit
Paper hands fuk
You paper handed?
That’s why no one will remember your name.
Why’d you hide the pickles from SpongeBob?
Have fun explaining to your wife's boyfriend why it wasn't $70,000.
WHEN ARE WE SELLING

On the Moond
The fuck is a sell
NEVER
Never
Not yet, when the time comes you will know.
Lmao we're only 30 min into the trading day.
?
It started at 4am eastern
Pre market volume was nothing compared to this. I don't count pre pre market time like that
The sell off begins.
For pussies
I wish I knew the realistic ceiling. Probably gonna drop out if/when it reaches 25 and hate myself.
Just put a 60 day quote stop at like 20 if it goes to 25.

It guarantees u lose nothing or even profit while u stay in in case it moons to 30+

Every 5 bucks it rises, raise your stop on quote price another 5. So u keep guaranteeing your profit with zero loss risk
Wow - great advice. Thank you sir!
Np. I was about to raise my quote sale to 25 but then the stupid ass circuit got tripped and it caused the price to fall to 23. But I'm still in! And if it hits 30 I'll change my quote order to 25.
You're a degenerate monkey not an ape. The squeeze of the hedge funds hasn't even started yet and you're dropping out at the first smell of tendies. You're gonna kick yourself everyday you see this sub for the next few months

Fuck it - you convinced me. Buying 50 more shares.
From the looks of things I hope you're happy, keep on hodling brother
This is addicting, but I’m gonna hold.
You are no ape. The squeeze of the hedge funds hasn't even started yet and you're dropping out at the first smell of tendies. You're gonna kick yourself everyday you see this sub for the next few months
Fuck it exploded so fast I didn't get a chance to sell before the halt 😅 last I checked was at 22
sell? you dumb?
That's called dumb luck. Consider yourself fortunate.
Sold at $19.70 for a total gain of +$11,500.

Reentry looks too risky right now. I'll come back if things look better.
This is just the usual slow down after a huge spike. It's not gonna crash but it will spike again either this afternoon or at market opening tomorrow
Maybe but to me it doesn't look like it's going to beat the last peak for a while. My gut says I'll get a better re-entry price if I wait.
Jumped back in when $20 held.
tagging you so I can laugh when you're crying EoW or even EoD
I've made a total of about $21k now. I'll be sobbing into my pile of money.

So if in theory I accidentally purchased weekly BBBY calls but with unsettled funds, and now they're massively up, would I theoretically have to wait for funds to settle before doing anything with them?    
    
Edit: Is the warning given per position sold or per violation instance? Like if I sold 2 calls, is that one or two gfv's? If I sold 1 today and 1 tomorrow is that 1 or 2 gfv's?
Might incur a good faith violation. You get a warning the first time.
Is the warning given per position sold or per violation instance? Like if I sold 2 calls, is that one or two gfv's? If I sold 1 today and 1 tomorrow is that 1 or 2 gfv's?
It's automated and I believe each individual trade using unsettled funds will trigger it.
I mean you could theoretically sell and maybe incur a gfv
Are u cash or margin acct?

If cash account selling now will trigger GFV

If margin you're fine unless your acct value is <$25k then it will trigger a PDT
DO I BUY MORE NOW OR WAIT FOR A DIP
New high fuck ye

BBBY can I come over after Scoo-oo°°°ool?

We can hang around by the mooo-oo°°°○○oon

didn't read it but upvoted for effort
Damn my watermelons
I just want my 400 dollars to be 650 is that too much to ask?
Nope!
Took some profit yesterday but I’m back baby! Let’s rock and roll!
Currently dont have any bbby and maybe will pick some up maybe not. Whats everyone’s realistic price targets for this?
This guy hahahaha
420,69
420,69
Im so sad that i didnt bought anything..thinking of buying in now but it just doesnt seem realisitic to get another 300-400%
This volume is a huge red flag if the US had an actual functioning SEC.  No way this isn’t market makers providing huge amounts of liquidity where it doesn’t otherwise exist.
What I don't get is if shares take t+2 to settle.  Then having all outstanding shares trades day after day should be impossible
GOT 18 AT 16.40 LFG
How high do you guys think ??? $25-$30
One Million doll hairs!
I'd rather think $35
21,69 is Fibonacci 23,6 retracement so don‘t be surprised if we hit the break around that region
Following RC, couple 80c for for January
OMG
What is happening when we all put our shares for sell at 1000k?
WE’RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW
Brace for crash
MY FUCKING PUTS.
They stopped it!
It's been paused in my app
Sold at the fucking peak lets go
Lol you think that's the peak nope!
well peak for now tho
dang bro i cant sell its halted
Fuck robinhood!!
It looks to be halted on Yahoo Finance now
Wtf is happening
why is my $80 call worthless?
It got halted, it’ll go back to normal don’t worry.
its halted, just hang on
Mines up 928% so shouldn’t be worthless
The hedges are halting
scum bags aren't they
SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER!!

My Jan 23 $80 calls just dropped 99% on that halt. Please someone explain I just lost 99% of my option value wtf is happening
Dude fucking relax you prepubescent retard
Dw it'll come back when unhalt. It's just a system thing during halts options like freeze prices
It’s fine. It’ll continue and show the proper amount.
Probably should learn about how what you're trading works before you buy in to shit like this
Why?
technical glitches
don't pay attention to that - it will re-price when trading resumes
my guy you are fine itll straighten out when they open the gates again
Dude I almost shit my pants.
Congrats to those that made it big! I am happy with my last 50$ turned into 1000$ (got in with 2 calls when it was at 6).
We going to the moon after this halt 🥴
Unhalted in Germany
Rip before dip
Im not into the stock game at all more of a Preious Metals guy but holy fuck i dont think ive ever seen a MF stock climb that quick
Holly shit Holly shit damn I wish I had bought some a month ago
BUUUUYYYY
Okay now it’s on purpose
Where’s the TA boys? What’s the support levels? TA boys, show us some lines plz
22.40 ish should be resistance
Why are my 1/20 $75c only worth .01 right now?
Glitch, it’s halted
I'll give you 0.02 for them
I'm trying to buy more haha
because we're halted
Wasn't the halt only 5 min?
we're on another circuit breaker, this time for downwards volatility

IV crush my dude
IV on those options was insane. Welcome to the casino.
Def enjoying my stay haha
WTF this? Why this stops?
Cuz we waz havn too much fun
It's a basic volatility halt. Not a grand conspiracy. Not anything at all.

>Volatility Halts

> Volatility halts are single stock circuit breaker halts that trigger 5-minute halts on fast price spikes or drops that exceed the acceptable trading price range (ATPR) for 15-seconds. The ATPR is calculated as the average price of the previous 5-minute trading period.
because to many buyers, 600 million volume
FIRE SALLEEEEEEEEE

How can it halt
They can hault any individual equity or the entire index if there is excessive or unusual trading.
Bbby to 30 eod
Halting is a Wallstreet scam to protect hedge funds from us retards.  Hedge funds give huge political campaign donations.  We don’t.
As of now
BGFV also squeezed last time 👀👀🚀🚀
[deleted]
I’m just saying watch it again for some quick short term profits 🤷🏼‍♂️
well that volume really slowed down....
Damn I want to get some of this stock after seeing how much it went up in 1 month but as soon as I do I bet it will go down a whole bunch... I am definitely going to buy some the next huge dip
Flag formation for bullish. Buy now with all your saving and money

#SO MANY BAGHOLDERS COPING LMAO

#WHO BOUGHT AVOVE 25?
I did.  Last run up.  27... been carrying these fkn bags awhile
profit taking at 20 lol
Imagine lmao
I’m out that was good
Poor guy. BRING HIM THE WATERMELON!!!!!!!!
Sold half at 24, gonna buy back in when she inevitably dips a bit later this week. Trying to take a little profits this time and perform better than I did with GME. never realized any gains, fucked myself. Not again lol
Some profit is better than none.
Nothing is “inevitable” here lmao.
Already regretting my decision lmao
Haha it’s gonna be a bumpy ride both ways friend. Let’s make some money.
but dude, this is our redemption arc.
Bbby will surely sell shares into this market. 20 millones shares, raise 500mm, have another 2q runway. If they don't, theyve missed the boat here
Sorry boys… sold for 110% profit.  Going back to the real play.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Stupid question but is it legal what this sub does?
completely
We like the stock.
No, cyberbullying is illegal
No, cyberbullying is illegal
[deleted]
Do it I dare you
is this the top after a 60% plus gain for the day
i have paper hands sold at $28 kinda regretting it now
Lmao, first time here?
yes actually, i’m enjoying my stay too
that mightve been a decent move
So buy back in then.  It's in the 25's now.
Just buy back in that was a good play
buy more with profit
BUY BACK
Lol jump back in
WERE BACK IN BOYS
sold everything at $28
You are a pussy lol
I just lost $1,000. I'm gonna throw up
If you sold that’s on you
Buy the dip
lol you ser, are gonna be a millionare if you hold
You don’t lose until you sell
I didn't sell. I lost $1,000 from $28 to $23.50. Still here.
How tf did you manage that
Watching it go from $28 to $23.50 my account went down $1K --
Ohhh lol I thought you opened a position right before the halt lol
First time?
How did you lose money we are still up 47% on the day?
I'm up for the day, that $28 - $23.50 was a hell of a drop for my account.
Young Padawon, HODL... all will be well. Dont panic, just chill and relax. Itll go up and down, but it will go to the moon.
holy shit its so rigged yet you retards think you're somehow gonna win
Get out
no bitches?
I mean, some people are gonna be winning if they time their exit right.
We are winning already
whos ready for another halt???

is it a good idea to set a stop loss?
Nope!
could you explain to me why?
Apparently short sellers will take advantage of many people setting stop losses, as it happened already with GME
In their ladder attacks I guess, I thought it might be a good idea to make sure I break even at least ($16.80)
Oh but you will, sooner or later. It’s just better that you press the button instead of being automatic,otherwise you can miss out on higher profits
The same reason why you don’t pull out
Bad idea with these swings
never, all or nothing
Google stop loss hunting
Bought at 16, stop loss at 18 now, so there's peace of mind! If you are the nervous type that will help
Panik sell and then joined back with same ammount at 15.87$ ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
time for puts ride the wave 🌊
time for puts ride the wave 🌊
Cashed out some profits. Still have 100 shares. Tits slightly less jacked as remorse setting in for selling early around 19.50.

Stock is still pumping and I'm holding the rest. LFG
has the squeeze been squoze?
Sold peak at 25
despicable
Nah man. Gotta at least make some cash :) still got options on bbby
wrong peak
Same for me brotherman
uh guys when do we sell🦍🦍
never
When you see commas in the price
when we hit $80
That’s the neat part. We don’t
What’s an exit strategy?
Pass the $100’s
Probably not today. It will be higher tomorrow once news of this has filtered out.
Sold my GME to buy more BBBY
This is the way
yo it’s dumping
Name checks out
Shorted 40@20
Haha
Can you put all your money on that, I want too see some loss porn
💀RIP
Bubble bursted
I paper handed yesterday at $14 thinking I would be able to reload at 12

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

Keep selling the bottom and buying the top
Was in originally at 6 but tripled my original position at 18.50 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
I sold
My meta for a few more bbby
Had us in the first half!
Hoping those few shares from Meta makes up for those losses
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
More for me 🤷‍♂️
#Should I take profits or be an ape and lose all unrealized gains?
take profits, spend the money, report back
Hold until at least 50!
We need a gme thread!!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4259)
Thanks lads! pocketing 72%, comming back tomorrow for more!
yessir
took 70% gain on BBBY , will jump back in if it ever dips
Lol I'm up 200% and holding
thats fine. everyone should have different sell limits.
U let us regards down, but hopefully it's for paying ur rent or aunt's yeast infection treatment or something important. See u soon 🚀🚀🚀
You fucked up
no I didn't it's called securing gains. nothing says I can't buy back in whenever I want.
I waited for it to drop to 17 to buy some more today but had to buy at 20 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
thats pretty normal with these pumps though.
I don’t think it will go below 20 for awhile
yeah I agree
Take profits, it's over. Don't be a bagholder
You’re a dumbass if you think it’s over lol
This what I’m saying man took my 85% profit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
What a retard lmao
Suck me

Why’d you have to ask us? Are you our sub?
Real talk - spreads on deep ITM calls are very wide.  So I assume this is a better time to exercise and sell the shares?
Fuck put me in coach! What number do we need to hit and for how long to make some hedgies cry?!
fomoed at 17 thinking im gonna lose my paycheck lol
What do you guys think will be the top?
Yes
Definitely
$80s, easily
$420.69 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)

Scum halted on etoro
that halt just ruined a lot of apes lol
Blue apron next bbby
GME popping!!
Dc
Should I sell towards the end of the day or hold for tmr
hold
Hold lol, you’ll just end up fomoing in at the higher price.
Bro THA fuck kind of question is that? Squeeze ain’t even started yet..
literally hold, you will make a killing, imagine if you held from yesterday when it was at 20
Hold for tom
Do I sell some gme position to get into bbby then buy back into gme? I need some guidance fellow regards for I am a lost regard
Never sell gme
selling GME is against our religion
no
Sorry for asking such a foolish question for I was not of sound mind when I asked it
No
no ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
No, 
that is not the way!
Do you, boo. 

Regards,

Regard.
I would not. You’d have to sell gme, wait for the money to settle, then buy in bbby after the run up and not at the beginning. Better off to just stay in game for that run up. Now if you have spare money lying around, totally different.
Fucking Robinhood won't let me sell!!!!!!,🤬🤬🤐🤐
Good
No one will remember your name
proof or ban
Hold!
Why you selling dummy?  BUY BUY BUY
It's on a halt
lol good.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Good
😂 who uses RH.
why would you sell?
good.
Bc you shouldn’t sell
when even Robinhood is trying to keep you from paperhanding
Time to put?
I paper handed lots of $5 Jan 2023 calls before it really started pumping for baby gainz . Bought calls when trading right around $5. Roast me plz
Question on why you sold? Still had 4 months to work with
Not too late brah
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)

Bought 300 calls when price was at 8.15 and paper handed at 12 cuz of FUD… bought back in but man I missed out on some gains
I also paperhanded way early on, I feel you. Got back in earlier this week though and this is great
BBBY fucks so hard
I spent some on BBBY and the rest on Nvidia. I'd have doubled my money if I made an actual regarded decision and blown all my savings on BBBY

I want to buy this again at $400, can we please do the bare minimum?
Hello 🍉
Holy shit, my stocks are up 100% and we're just getting started
I love you all! At least that’s the mood I’m in when making money 😆 🍉
I just popped in my face
LOOK AT IT GO
at this rate throwing money at 0DTE calls don't seem regarded at all
H
Wow I feel like I bought in so late. My cost average is just below $10.
What will you do with all the money you will get?
Probably loose it
OH SNIKEYS
I love you guys
I like moniez!
I haven’t been this stoked for something since the early GME hype. Let’s fucking go! 🚀🌕
Someone gimme money to buy more
fomoed at 17 thinking im gonna lose my paycheck lol
*I will absolutely definitely positively categorically not buy until Anthony Chukumba says so!*
Exceeding EOW prediction on a Tuesday? BOBBY my guyyyyy
Holy fuck! Oh Lois I’m coming
The nostalgia is real. I love all of you.
😋😋
who's buying puts
Damn dirty apes
Damn I sold my options before it blast off like crazy
Same but ngl my acc was worth like 1.1K and making 150$ profit meant so much I had to sell
This explains how "market makers" are shorting without find the stock.   Specifically mentions Citadel using this exemption.  No wonder Cramer and short hedge funds in full blown panic with a BS "downgrade" today too.  BBBY can go more parabolic than $AMC and $GME without HOOD having the ability to turn off the buy button https://mobile.twitter.com/dlauer/status/1559201020332457984
Huge fucking dildo, that’s all I can see.

Lezz go gentleman
Buy or die— those who have been eating a shit sandwich all year, this is redemption! Take up arms by buying stock! We collectively can break the wheel! Keep holding through the halts. Let these trust fund babies go belly up. Let them know what life is like when you have to fight for something.

Shares or calls? Either way covering your initial investment isn’t the worst thing ever (despite what others here will probably tell you) but if you’re up anything like I am then that’s only a small part of your position

Hey why don’t you shut the fuck up?
Amc  needed to just sit there until this is over..... so I have the funds to short it back to where it belongs. AA is a thriving Muppet.

Pussy
Paper handed pillock
Still early to get in on SST with some profits. Low float de-spac with good recent earnings that announced 25 million in buy backs. Cheap options.
Looks like flat is back on the menu Boyz
BBBY to $100 today.
Bagged profit - but definitely gonna buy more after this dip
if you keep trading this will just end sooner ,no advise im regarded
Guys please hit $13 so i can cover my shorts... my kids want to eat tonight :((
Your kids can eat watermelon. I need a lambo
What is the price target of BBBY so I can sell?
“How dare you!”
420.69
🌕
SELL!!!!
That’s why no one will remember your name
Who is also aboard the $GETY train
You should gety the fuck outta here
Can somebody message me if there's a big dip so I can buy more? lol
guys 30$ the top ?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Hedge funds hate this one secret tip: there is no top
This is so difficult and not so difficult at the same time. Difficult to not sell, CAUSE I AIN'T SELLIN', and Not difficult, cause it takes no effort to not push the key to sell. ;) Cheers, Mates! 

Hodor?
Should I buy more shib
When will it dip? I wanna buy
lemme just pull my crystal ball (7 inches in diameter) out of my rectum.
i've never seen anything like this before... is...is this...sustainable?
Im afraid we going down. Please talk me off the ledge.
You know trailing stop orders are a thing right?  Set a pull back target and just let it ride.

But guys, Adam Aaron is issuing a APEs
rev
Another one I missed out on. Didn’t believe Kodak years ago. Missed it. Missed GMC. Missed AMC. What’s next 🥹
Alright guys, honestly, how are y’all playing this. Complete hold??? Or selling some on the way up
C’mon man, “bets” is in the name!

Sincerely though, depends on your position size. If you went absolutely balls deep, I’d sell enough to cover your cost basis for your sanity (ex. Bought 100 @ $16, sell 50 @ $32 and ride the rest). That being said, the example I just gave is exactly what I did with GME… and I’d be kicking myself for that trade if I didn’t also have options at the time.

If it’s a small position (>5% of your account), I’d hold all and sell when you’re happy. Set this number in advance and *stick to it*. Don’t get too greedy! I held GME shares at $300 that I ended up selling for $150 down the line. Still a big gain, but greed turned my insane return into a very good one.
What if I want to add more? Lol how would you play that? Just keep buying?
Up to you dude. At this point, you’re playing a game that is very tough to win (timing a squeeze). Best of luck!
HODL
I’m hodling![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Full hold
Selling on the way down. Better to take some 10-20% less than peak vs. Selling at 30$ just to see it Swing to 500$/share
NFA, if u want to make the "buck" exit at 100% for halve the share u got and let the rest ride out or u can go tits up and add more
Big sell wall at 23. Next foundation before more 🚀🚀🚀
True 24 will be a harder wall which it might dance around……past that 30 is a inbounds for landing
Buy buy baby is what I’ll be saying to my boss when BBBY hits $45k per share
You only profit when the stock is sold, what happens with 10,000,0000 people try selling at the same time?
WE DID IT
Wil it get crazier when it resumes
Gme hodlers:  are we the distraction ??
No way. We’ve had similar runs
Let’s see gme do a 20%. Its beens years.
Good question, nah 😃 We are the meme stock king. Bbby is just finally shining as the the third shorted stock. 

1. Gme 
2. Amc
3. Bbby
Wtf is this bullshit, ikbr just halted any market data on bbby
RH just locked up
When stocks are halted my options are worthless? My account just went red showing my options which were worth $300 are now worth zero?
It is because during a halt, all orders are cleared then replaced. So the price is kinda $0, but not really. Once the LULD is clear, it'll fix itself.
Hold I have to buy a new motorcycle! Please 🥺
I sold my last 6000 BBBY and bought another $70k worth of GME. 

Rotation was imminent.
Rug pull initiated

Easy come, easy go
I am disappointed that we aren't squeezing this thing to the moon in a by lunch.  Have we lost our touch?
We would have if they didn’t put a halt
It‘s even getting $GME up
WE’RE BACK
How most likely will it look EOW?

WTF
Hmm I might have been wrong. Might run to 40 this week if strength returns after 2nd halt. Originally called ~25 max which looked right after first halt.

Huge coin flip on 20 or 40.... Don't bet what you can't afford to lose people
It may go up or down from here. Great analysis
Gavin just sent out stimmy checks too to buy votes in a state that always votes democrat. LFG!

if you don't mind answering, how did you know?
I did not. Did I win?
Yea
Cool.  I guess I should have actually had a position lol
This page has to much spam bullshit and half the shit I see is terrible and vague claims. Most of you are sheep and would follow anyones advice.

Genuine question - do people trade Earnings results (ie get in before the earnings are released?)

The main criticism seems to be that folk liken it to gambling (because nobody knows earnings before they are released), but there must be ways of working it out?
I have no idea what I'm participating in
It was fun tho
I lose every single time and still dump 100 tokens into every prediction lol

I think I've won 3 predictions in 2 months
I have a great prediction history but a shitty portfolio history.
I've just been guessing with 100 tokens everytime but it's working since I went from 1000 to 2000

Any thoughts on APA? I picked up a few shares. The ROE is 470%, low debt, and good free cash flow.
What are your additional thoughts on ApA?
It’s working out great for me.
You are long because you're bag holding. "You can't lose if you don't sell"
Not exactly. I’m an investor not a trader.
I think it could be less bad than people expect.
Apparently raising prices did not stop people from buying coffee.

Also im pretty sure most people without shovel adjacent iq’s will all realize the huge savings of making your own coffee at home.  With a  keurig even the biggest coffee newb  can access  a way cheaper nd much wider variety of choices.    Also im sorry but unless the coffee is getting replaced at sbux every 30 mins it leads to shitass coffee. Tht makes dunkin donuts coffee taste like heaven

What do we win when this prediction fails?
agreed
I did green for all, fuck it
This is the TLDR; thank you for your service
My prediction is that I'm gonna pull out of the market and just invest in anime body pillows or some shit bc at this point it's worth more.
Soooo is this for MONDAY August 1st or TUESDAY August 2nd?  Cuz Monday, August 2nd is not today. heh

Agree,  especially not after the jump last week and getting banned in Indonesia over the weekend.

Ah nvm not leaps, $20 a contract… LOLLLL you’re fucked man

What about AMC earnings aug 4th? with the top grossing movies of all time within the quarter?
The dollar euro exchange rate might help their bottom line.
BP probably destroyed on profits, but guidance feels up in the air, with oil prices declining. But if last Friday's earnings were any indication, all the oil calls will print next week too.
Agreed

Kinda crazy that +-5% is considered flat
AMD and then NVDA i bet will do good
HKD to the Moon then in about 2 weeks to the Moon again, but this time down and trough the Earth.
This is a cult
Siga will hit 50$ by end of year. I currently own 14 shares, cause I'm broke, very small portfolio. Might buy a long dated call for next to nothing.
Oh my gourd!

What calendar are all these retards using
The Gregorian has no power here
This is all the gambling I need in my life right now
These prediction threads fucking suck!

What’s the point of these karma whoring prediction posts anyway? I see them all over Reddit
The market has done so badly this year that weather earnings is a hit or miss, price will go up. If it goes any lower, its gonna be a tough 2023 too.
Tell that to SWK and Intc
Intel execs say that last qtr was the bottom so there's no place to go but up from here 

right?
....right???

We will see when AMD reports.. if revenue is way up that means they are eating away at Intel. If it's down, maybe segment weakness. 

Intel lost 7% rev last quarter. That is a really bad sign if there is no logical explanation for it. 

I get with investment net income will fall off but sales to dump off like that.. not good.
Swk dropped (then I bought calls) but it recovered some about like WMT did after their news. It all should've been expected & priced in. Just a shock to the stock
Dangit, thought that said AMC

I hope Six Flags tanks a but fuck ton, I’ve worked for them not to long ago for a while. Such a dogshit company

Rivian will continue to grow but their product is trash
Wanna throw $100 in rivian for ER . Suggestion?
Pros: investment in domestic chips, EV from climate package, lower rate, all this means is temporary boost
Cons: Monkeypox, Russia, China, recession, inflation, real estate slightly down

Some things will go up temporarily like last few days but then even more down.
Never bet against the mouse
EV's have good news with that inflation reduction act, but the current RIVN lineup doesn't even meet the qualifications for the EV tax credit right?
Rivian earnings tonight AH

As a lowes manager, there is no way on our earnings call that we make it. 75% of all stores aren’t making plan, half are not making shrink. And roughly 40% aren’t even comping. So yea I’m taking the under -2.5%

How come I always find these things after they already took off? Is there an alert list or something so I don't miss out?
If you could sell after I do that'd be great
Long way to go before selling starts
420.69 is not a meme
420.69 is the only acceptable target price. The pump continues until then, no exceptions!
I thought the only acceptable target price was if... IT'S OVER 9000?!
If we pass 420.69 then the only other acceptable target is 4206.90 or 42069.00 and so on.
If 42069.00 is acceptable than both target statements are true because that would mean...IT'S OVER 9000!!! 😎
That’s not realistic
Wait are you saying BBBY can't be worth as much as Berkshire or Maersk? °o°
420.69 is what I am looking to receive for my shares as well
Cuz it’s exactly the amount I need to buy weed and pay my wife to 69 me
precisely
Yup. 500$+.

Nope.  Baby whale at best.   Real ones are on the way
Please tell me you have friends richer than yourself entering a position and that’s how you know this?
Sounds more like a hunch that we are all rooting for.  The only thing hedgies like better than stealing our money is fucking over other hedgies and taking their money.   
It's probably better than sex with multiple prostitutes for them.
90% of the rise the past two weeks is hedges or giant whales. Same as it always is.
lol half the medium effort posts in this group are just hedgie promotional content, I assume.

You don’t need college if you have enough to yolo 2 mill on 1 stock
2 million used to be a lot before inflation, now it's just like the regular price of a banana in San Francisco
Back when I was a kid, they were like, 10 dollars or something
Send me  amil pls
Maybe don’t live in an overrated overpriced location then
When ya got 2mil this is one of the few times that's a valid argument
Are you my girlfriend's boyfriend?
He may not be but with enough persuasion he may just agree to become

Your son is overrated. I mean college. Ahh fuck it.
> Ahh fuck it.

His son or college?
I wanna party with yoooou!
Welll....what did you do OP??? Cuz I wanna do it
Don't say this about your son, make him decide if he want to go to college, don't let money cloud your mind
Take your sensical nonsense shit out of here. We don't need that shit. We need moar Ape! With Diamond hands!

College with that bankroll would be a missed opportunity.  Don't deprive your son of that.

No it's not. At no point yesterday was ASTS at $12.75 when BBBY was at $16. All the perfectly even numbers is the easy give away.
Except at, well, the closing price.   Lol
Closing prices aren't final or determined at 4 pm (still adjusting for final trades) and both prices would have adjusted for AH trades. So even if you took this "screenshot" right at 4 pm the prices weren't this.
Just how drunk are you?
Not sure why you need this screenshot to be real. But watch close today if you think I'm wrong. What you see at 4 pm will not be the same as the official close price.
You can have your balances set to show the closing price instead of after hours prices, and if you did that then these are the prices you would see right now lol.

Edit: having said that, it may well be fake. I don't really care.
I’m going to play the calculator game and see how much it’s worth @$300 a share. 😳$42,000,000.00🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 I’ll be holding brother Let’s Fucking Go!!!!!!
My man 💪
42 is the answer! ;)
I’d make you take a bet but I know this virgin account would just get deleted and this photoshopped screenshot would get lost in the abyss.
See you again at $20m, and you can do whatever you want to innocent watermelons in the meantime
people get murdered for way less money so they probably want to avoid getting dox'd and robbed but still want the attention :D
this m\*\*\*\*rf\*\*ker is gonna win big - or die big

Unless its all fake
option 1 pls
Fake post to fomo more 22 year olds
Does the fomo disappear at 23? Please I need to know
No, but maybe at 28… I need to know
Yep, nothing suspicious about this almost inactive account posting a wildly high position in a cropped screenshot. Nothing at all!
..... with perfectly round number gains.
Person is “buying” 100k shares. I think that is how it works. Just take your 1 share gain and move the decimal 5 times.
Other positions are shameful.  Just sold Meta to buy bbby tho
tl;dr - either this guy's a secret millionaire who also is somehow ashamed of his other positions *or* he's trying to trick dumb "apes" into buying ASTS through follow-on hype for BBBY.
Its not magic, I just don’t use Android.  
& It’s alphabetical
lol yeah you could crop out the timestamp  at the top but couldn't crop out the other position, makes sense. just post an unedited updated screenshot bro, you can make people like me stfu so easily. 

by the way, people don't go from "lurking" to replying to every fucking post in the thread - this is the fakest shit ever.
Not to take away from conspiracy theories, but it’s just an exciting time and I can’t sleep before open
if it's so exciting take another screenshot and post it brother
Sure, after open.  If you want to see some red, no sweat.  Here for the long haul
I want to see a screenshot not to verify but just the idea of seeing what a gain or loss even LOOKS like at that much money
Big dipppp
Asts good investment
Yeah, ASTS is snuck in there. These seems like a pump post.
There's a guy in the morning WSB calls that tries to shill that shit. They get roasted pretty good for their DD.
Now that you point it out very suspicious
I've seen a few bbby hype posts here coming from accounts that have been inactive since the GME squeeze
We're holding the same stocks, will I be rich like you soon?
Bro just made $2m today lol.
Now that’s big dick energy. Not that angry guy calling out others with $5k.
Can we hit $100 by the end of the week?
Let’s not impose unnecessary limits
You’re right. To the moon! 🚀🚀🚀
man shoulda put at least a few thousand in calls XD
Made almost half a Millie so far the jump has not even started? This is how lambos and yachts are bought easily
You may want to take some profits right about now.
You think this guy ever takes his foot off the gas?
Seems a bit fishy on ur acc, if its real than damn nice
Fr. Kinda sus
I believe additional verification, like a video of you entering the trading app and bringing up the position is usually asked for when posting a yolo this large.

&#x200B;

Paging u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR
Proof after open
I call bullshit on OP.  The Holy Ghost told me he is Karma farming and full of shit.
couldn’t care less about reddit karma
Why post then
Pumping his bet by turbocharging the momentum with a 2M boost
I bought back in after seeing this post so its definitely effective. Already up 30% lol
it will destroy his credit karma
Fuck 30k would be life changing money for me, and you through in 2 mil. I wish you all the best and that autistic make your first billion of BBBy
If you f a watermelon on only fan you can make some $$$
I never thought of making money off of my hobbies
I can see why 30k would be life changing for you, through it wasn’t obvious at first.

Welcome home!!!!!!! You belong here
715 is life changing money...
IM FUCKING **JACKED**
Buy the dip 100$$ coming
Satellite PHONEEEEEE. ASTS to the moon or Atlantis idk
I think the true intent of this post is the hidden message to actually start buying $ASTS.
This post made me sell half my shares. In @ 11, out at 25. Learned my lesson not getting too greedy.
ASTS. Ah a man of culture.☝️
ASTSSSSSSSSS <3
This guy is having a good day
This gotta be a paper account how tf do people have 2 mil just sitting around to throw at a meme stock lol
ASTS, too.

This guy fucks
Time to savre Ryan and his Gamestop and BBBY. We will be there when you buy the broke hedgies’ wives to be your female butlers. 🦧🦧🍌🍌
To be fair if you got 2 mil to put on this is not really a yolo you just ballin or maxed every card and to every loan you could which is the way! Either way congrats on upgrading that M to a B soon 🚀🚀🚀
Dude just invested the money i will ever own in my life
Congrats on your big balls
I guess I have no choice but to fomo back in now!
How is this not market manipulation? If you guys believe this is real and not some stooge playing with you guys, ive got a bridge to sell you
Posted proof.  Sorry to disappoint your skepticism
[removed]
I posted multiple updated screenshots one minute apart and differing prices in a separate post, 15 min after open.
Op just made bands
At first I thought it was options, but shares is still a big bet. Congrats! I'm really Jealous, but also happy, NO I'M NOT happy for you. :D:D:D
Motherfuck….
Shit halted 🤣
did you cash out
Lambo time 😎
Another milionaire is made thanks to meme stocks.
Congrats, and fuck you! :)
How many wifes did you already fucked?
This guy could retire now
Positions or ban
Mods - proof or ban please
Fake and silly
As whales come in, so will institutional interest. BBBY going places.
My thoughts exactly
Being called out as fake and not providing proof not bring fake, makes it a whole lotta fake
Y’all really have no idea about paper accounts. Really pushing that retardness to the limits here.

Edit: “first seen in WSB 11 seconds ago” LOLOL
Retards: “what are paper accounts?🤔” 😂😂
People fall for this. Yikes
Bruh

whales are big and slow, thats why they always show up late
Not late. They don't need the 100x. They get filthy rich with just the 4x in 2 years. That's tremendous. If a whale gets in before the rip, it goes to 2000 and back to 150, they are happy to sell for an average of 90. Whales are whales because they are right on time.

What is your guess on peak price of BBBY?
⬆️
I would assume that lol best of luck homie 🙌🏻  just lmk before you leave I only have a couple hundred in it won't hurt you 😂
My tiny pittance makes no difference.  
PS don’t wait for the message until you see triple digits
Could I get an update on how much you're up today?? 😮‍💨
5M
That's insane
imagine being in such a position that you can just casually throw a couple of mil at a stock.

I was here shitting it over my $200 I put in.
Yeah. One day we’ll make it but today all I can throw in is a few hundred damnit.
keep the faith thou bro, good luck!
Wait a minute I though we didnt make money here?
as its sitting at $28 wowwwwwwww
How much profit did you make so far?
0.  Didn’t sell.  Unrealized ~2M
I get it man, at least sell some so you can take your original money out and then you can play with all the profit, you’ve basically almost doubled your money

Nothing worse than being retarded retard
Yeah I’d do the same. He’s already rich so just take that 2M profit and play with the houses money
Holy shit this touched $4m today

Gz dude
You have your allocation backwards sir
Dude.
No calls? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Any thoughts on a realistic price target for the BBBY squeeze?  Where/when are you selling and taking profits?
So I accidently sold a covered call... how do I close it out?
Expensively
Fubo 🌙 🌚 🌔 🌕
The big jump up is coming!!!
What’s PL now
What is the name of this app?
Reddit
LMAO !😂
CS - dark mode
Whoa, I've never been able to screenshot in Schwab. Is there a way to turn that on or do I just call them when I have 2 mil deposited?
Pretty sure this is sarcasm but this is a mobile app screenshot
No, not sarcasm (at least not the first part). My mobile Schwab app blocks me from screenshots.
Maybe he has a galaxy note and is using smart select?

Nevermind he said he has an iPhone... so shit I dunno.
Yea, might just be android problem for me. I'll keep doing some digging.
They’ll call you
When an app stops you to screenshot, you can do it by using web page account.
But they just said theirs is an in app screenshot
No idea.  iPhone, USA
Don't know about. I know my app stops me from screenshot, so I do it on laptop.
I have an iPhone and Schwab app. I can take screenshots. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How do i know this isn’t a paper account?
No paper hands allowed
My thoughts exactly

well boys, top's in with this and that ziptrader youtube guy finally picking up bbby, it was fun
Calling top won’t age well
I'm mainly just kidding anyway lol. Although that Ziptrader dude has a pretty bad track record of talking about a stock at its zenith and same for extremely large yolos from new accounts. Definitely not trading off all that, just making a crappy joke that way too many will probably take seriously.

I don't think RC's boys are done just yet blasting through resistance with high volume at highs, you know, like normal unmanipulated stock action tends to do.
How are they all perfect numbers
Is this shit real?? Or paper trading account??
Bullshit, new account
I posted proof
PROOF OR BAN
I posted separate proof, take a look
A video? Or just screenshots..?
3 separate screenshots 1 min apart, this AM price  traceable, 8:45 ish est     2 stocks referenced
Lol fuck off. We've seen this kind of bullshit here hundreds of times before, and it's always the same.
It’s legit.   Suit yourself
It’s going to at least $25 maybe even $40 so congrats your wife’s bf would be proud
And I’m suppose to believe that a person with two million is a normal average trader? Ok bye
Please let us know when you plan to sell so I can time my put purchase correctly. 🤣
That last push before the halt added another 10% on your position in 3 minutes :D:D:D
Yo show us your account now lol
This is bullshit and ASTS is a piece of shit, even if you're out in the middle of the ocean.

ASTS: \*enables connectivity for billions who don't have it and others in more areas\*

ASTS: \*causes Ericsson and Qualcomm to work together to compete with them even though they are years behind\*  
Dumbfuck ape: This is bullshit

Dumbfuck ape: So what you can connect everywhere? Who wants that?
How high is bbby going i wonder?
Just imagine a lot
this reeks of a pump and dump scam.
🩳 ?
meh.  It's only a 23% gain.   Op threw in $1.7M to make $427k.  He probably has $10M of disposable money lying around. 

I am not impressed.
Planning to DRS?

Did you check the number of shares? No matter what the price, there will be zeroes in total value.

You regard on a different level.
[deleted]
They MAY have decimals, but you are not a trader else you would know that the decimals are rare in the entire daily tape, to OP has 99% chance to hit a second decimal then to hit a 5th decimal.

Nice math skills, btw.
Lol what?
Cs shows 2 decimal points …
Yeah he's an idiot
Or the fact that it closed at 16.00 exactly?  But don’t let math stop you
This is more than likely a pump and dump scam.
give me 100 dollars pls
 Buy 1 share and wait 1 mo
Yeah - private investor for sure 😆😆

This is second coming of DFV, the prophecy is true. HODL THE FUCKING LINE and HAIL SATAN
Look at the open interest on the Jan 20 2023 $80 call
Would you buy a 3-day $24 call for .83?
If you could exercise about 1k of those calls, that’s be great
Legend!
Nice. Fuck those shorts.
Holllly
I'm starting to regret selling at $12.05
(I bought at 9.36 and made 40%) in a couple days.

Can I call you daddy?
Bbby asts gang checking in
(whispers) what the fuck
Fkn rock hard rn
Holy fuck

Is there a website where I can see the real-time short interest of BBBY?
I'd love to know if that was yolo'd today or a weeks ago lol
Congratulations

what's the price target?
That dude made milly today😀 congrats!
And just like that he was up to 4 mill
Where we stopping next $25?
keep going

Fuck me I missed the boat on Bbby and now I got my dick in hand like a fucktard.

Wow.  How many call options do you own?   You have King Kong size balls.  Man!!!
Buy GME with the profits, pussy
I am also big on ASTS

Positions or ban
What fo you think of ASTS?
WOW
Need an update
This guy fucks.
Gzz on the big fucking W
Nice.
When someone sells this much, I assume it's not a market order. How long does a limit at say 28 stay up with something like this?
I don’t use limits
If you had bought calls this morning you'd be up $20,000,000. Fuuuuuck.
I choose gratitude over wishful thinking

I would dump , who the fuck shops at bed bath and beyond 💀
BBBY seems to be a loser that people would like to participate in. Crazy world. I prefer stocks with big, real potential like LKNCY.
You sound like a loser.
You glorious idiot.

Did you make your 2M selling drugs?

Honest question - was the money earned or is it fast money made with crypto/NFT and other recently popular shitty "investments"?

Good luck in any event.
Lol Earned, and a fool and his money are soon parted and all that.  I didn’t do much crypto (<30k, now down a lot) and no nfts.   & No drugs needed.  Bbby > blow
So you know the next question - what industry were/are you in?

Cheers.
That explains today's price movement. I bet you sell at 20% gains though and leave us with the bags
Wew lad u true hater forreal
Sell now and jump into AMC and hit their next 70% gain
No thank you
Thank you for your service🙌

Two million divided by 2000 is 9.  9 escorts

Sell ASTS and throw those gains into BBBY too. No reason not to!
Done.  Position is 3M now
Holy crap you fucking rule! You’re not a whale, you’re a GOD!
I actually hope it hits 420.69 just because the profit youll make will be so impressive. I truly hope you buy something cool to show us here.

Same. Bought at 8 sold at 11.40 and bought in again today
Someone must have hit him with a positions or ban
Probably around 420.69$
694.20 ser
Yes! Very important! Easy Money
BBBY will hit 80$+ in January or February for sure

Some people were skeptical if he is still in those calls, get fcked 🥰
Before. Why else would his expiration be in Jan
So because he bought at those strikes; price will get there? 🤡🌎
History doesn't always repeat itself. But what happened last time Ryan invested in a company with >100% short interest? Worth having a small piece just in case?
You think BBBY has SI > 100%?

edit: lmao getting downvoted for merely questioning a fact that's verifiably wrong. Tell me you're in a cult without telling me you're in a cult.
It was reported over 100% a few weeks ago, and most funds raised their short positions
That's no longer accurate. [Best estimate as of 2 weeks ago](https://imgur.com/a/rMcKESM) puts it at 50% max. It's still nothing to scoff at, but we still shouldn't exaggerate.
Institutional ownership is at 60M.  That doesn't include Cohen and Freeman's shares, 15M.  The float is fucking negative.  The fuel is loaded, ignition has begun
Isn’t 50% the new 100% though since they f’d with the formula that calculates it?   
Went and did my research before finishing. This is what I was thinking of https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf so is it S3 50% which means it’s really 100% or is it 38M shares out of 76M?
50% is still insane in the membrane breh

He wants to make BBBY big again and bought the highest Calls possible...i believe in 50$ without a squeeze and with squeeze 100$+
Pretty much, yeah. At least that's where my money is, outside of my gme shares of course.
Glad you can shamelessly admit you base your financial decisions on thoughts/actions of others

Ive seen people say “you think prices will hit $xx+ 🤡🤡🤡” for every price we’ve shattered so far. Hope you have fun buying at 99 for FOMO.
Yeah man; that’s exactly how it’s gonna go ![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)
I’m up 260% already why would I need copium buddy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Because this is luck at best. You cant say where this is gonna go and for how long. 

So you’re flexing on getting lucky right now as if it couldn’t go wrong any second lol
Not really "luck" to recognize a billionaire bought into a company with a very specific set of ideas on how to turn the company around and waiting to buy in at a lower price. That's sound investing when the thesis is strong.

Swear to god, people like you sitting on the sidelines bitching about "it's just luck".
That’s a lot of words to rationalize buying because you saw RC do it too. 

If that’s your “thesis” then yes- you’re just hoping to get lucky. And you reinforce the idea of making the right choice with the thought of a biLlIoNaIre doing it first; and he “can’t” be wrong because he’s a biLlioNaIRe.
...that's literally what an investment thesis is. "a lot of words to rationalize buying".

If the thesis was just "Cohen bought", then I wouldn't be sitting on 570% gains. Instead, I did what actual investors do and *read his letter to the board.* And then I watched the board's response and waited until BBBY was in the single digits, knew Cohen hadn't sold out despite sitting on unrealized losses of 60%+ and got confirmation the company was negotiating to give him 3 board seats - people on the board with the shareholder's interests in mind.

But sure, keep telling yourself whatever you want. It's "just luck" when others make more than you.![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)

Welcome to stocks buddy if there was a man on this earth that could do any of this shit you just said he’d be the first multi trillionaire. Also not flexing just showing you no matter how badly you wish for apes to fail we’re still up tremendously. over even the best trading return %s. Also once again literally any stock on the market is luck and can go wrong in seconds 😂.
Who said I wanted you to fail? You gotta stop creating imaginary enemies 😂

And no; some people trade based on levels/news. Let’s stop pretending like every stock is a meme stock now 🤡🌎
Of course because news/levels work everytime ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641) listen buddy thats still luck and a 50/50 at best. Buy you some BBBY, turn your phone off for a week or two, then come back and lets have a conversation.
I already got bbby; but I’m not gonna be a clown and act like this is gonna go up forever. I’m day trading it. Up $900 today. Not gonna hoDL like a true retard. 

Remember gme? Look at them now lol
Yes look at them now millionaires immortalized in this sub and other up hundreds of thousands. I get not wanting to hold for a year+ but dude acting like $80 is out of the question this year is ridiculous.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Oh you mean the other stock Ryan Cohen bought into that then proceeded to run all the way up to 550 during a short squeeze interrupted by unprecedented intervention?

Yea, I think I can hold a little longer on this one.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Ok genius, tell me why he bought OTM call.

I’m listening.
He can sell the calls for profit regardless of if the strike price is hit, provided the conditions are right.  Unless he is contractually obligated to exercise, but I have not seen that mentioned anywhere.

You all are going to get bag held lol. Bed bath and beyond is a shithole that's going out of business. Just get off your PC's and actually go into a store to see for yourself. This sub is so fucking compromised.
Not why people are playing it.
There is no intrinsic value of the options till 60-80$ but I see what your trying to say.
>  Even if that does not occur, any rally that takes the stock ***above $30*** – which was the stock’s rough price level toward the end of March – will result in outsized gains for Cohen on the back of the increase in these options’ ***intrinsic*** value.

Wat...  Okay - whoever wrote this is an idiot.  $60 to $80 options have zero intrinsic value at $30.  All value is extrinsic until you are ITM.
Should I YOLO options or shares?
Shares. The IV on the options is well over 200% for anything close, meaning the options are pricing in 20$ swings in the share price
Didn't understand that so I did both. Thanks.
ELI 5
A bunch of morons want to play the lottery right now so the price of lotto tickets has mooned.
lol I dont have the time 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp)

essentially, the higher the IV is on something. the more its assumed its going to move in any direction, making such movement affect the option less than something with low IV.
Oh so the volatility is already priced in therefore they move the contract less money, that makes sense. But when I see a contract for 16 strike price gain $500 in a day….. It definitely would’ve been a right move at open if anything
Don't fuck with options
Why though? If I would have bought a call at 16  with Sept exp, I would have made $500 a contract

What is the risk? Losing it faster than you would shares? Or the contract not filling when trying to sell?
I'm not an options expert. There's 1 that you can lose bad enough to owe money. The other one you can only lose what you put in.
I’m so regarded I’m ready!!
*returded

why? why he disclosed it now? hes position hasnt changed and he doesnt have to fill this for again? or am i missing something? 🤔
His position didn't change, but the % ownership of the company did. Therefore, the company most likely reduced their float (stock buyback)
Now wait a minuut. Cramer is beging them to sell shares… and they did the opposite you say? 

I say bullish!
makes sense 🤙
Then why did RC file the Form 3 so late?  
  
The “event” which was 10K stating reduction in shares outstanding, thus raising RC’s stake in BBBY from 9.8% to 10%+, happened 4 months ago in April (shares out. was \~98M at time of Schedule 13D filing; and reduced to \~70M shares in 10K). Form 3 instructions from SEC clearly state, the Form must be filed within 10 days of the event, so why is it filed now?
As far as I know, it is an update
The event was BBBY saying they would buyback # of shares by a given date. RC position literally has not changed but his % ownership did.

What else do you think could have physically happened? You are a moron, thats basic math.
He’s required to fill out that form every 3 Months regardless of if he changes his position or not.
Form 3 was due to the SEC yesterday for all Hedge Funds
Far otm low cost calls being used as a proxy for advertising to his retarded believers.
🤣👌 im making like 1000% gains now thanks to his „advertising” lol
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
Imagine being a RC hater. How retarded can you be
Well I did some DD and I found that the stock should go higher.  
First, as part of any great DD, I looked at BBBY’s stock price in June, around $6 per share. Then I used the internet to check what web traffic BBBY had in July compared to June. About 41M visitors to their webpage, up from 38M in June. That’s an 8% increase. More web traffic = More customers = More revenue = Higher stock price. Makes sense.  
Then I looked at how many people that downloads BBBY’s mobile app (because converting app users to real clients that spend money is tight). Up from around 1,800 daily downloads in June to 3,000 in July. That’s an 72% increase!  
Then I looked at how many followers BBBY has on Facebook. Towel-buying people loves Facebook and guess what!? 8,000 new followers since June, a modest increase of 0.3%.  
And last but not least, and this is when it gets really advanced, I compared the number of mentions on Reddit in June to the start of August. Because reddit mentions = higher stock price. BBBY was mentioned around 50 times per day in June BUT 3,000 times per day in the last week. That’s an increase of 5900%.  
Now, if I know anything about percentages, it is that you add them all up. So 8% + 72% + 0.3% + 5900%. That’s an increase in 5980.3%!!  
So you take the percentage increase of 5980.3% \* $6 and you get what the stock is really worth - $365!  
**TLDR**: I did the math and BBBY should be worth $365 per share. It’s basic math sheeple.
Nice volume to start! Today is the day
Hey retard thanks you gave me the incentive to finally thro 1k into bbby

E: I like the stock
Hold the lineeeee
It's looking more and more likely that BBBY could actually hit these levels
Those strike prices aren't even offered
How do I buy BBBY today? My robinhood account takes 3-4 days to deposit money.
It let's me begin a transfer (up to 10k) and invest so long as the money is in account and withdrawal date.
It let's me begin a transfer (up to 10k) and invest so long as the money is in account and withdrawal date.
Bought 15 shares and have an order in for another 10 @ $16 

Let’s see :D
Best of luck!

To the fucking mooooooooon!!!!!! 🚀🌙😎
Buy bbby Eargo go up today 1,70
Loss farming, or his accountant should slap him
Pissed I didn’t HODL. got out when it dipped back below $9.
If he’s still in, I’m still in
If he’s still in, I’m still in
I only have like 5 shares but I’m so glad I still bought it despite the nay sayers
Back in at $22. Here we gooo
Bbby is going crazy right now, hodl the line apes.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Etrade not letting me buy BBBY 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🫠🫠
Invest on margin if you’re serious Cohen🚀
He'd be up on those considerably now. It makes no sense for him to hold those and exercise at $80. He's going to exit once he believes the short/gamma squeeze is over. Probably after some amount of buy volume has transpired.
That would be the smart thing to do.
Wait. No, the article does not say that he is still holding those calls right now. Those numbers are from April.
Yes but an "update" had to be submitted because his stake in the company changed from 9.8% to over 10% because BBBY bought back shares thus shrinking their float.
Bought in April. This shows he still holds them
Either way it would be easy to check open interest of those strikes and see he’s still in
His longs don’t affect open interest tho
Look at the bottom of the form, it has date on it - Aug 15th... So confirms he still has the position.
That's the date of the form...for the event that took place in April.
That’s what I’m saying
Putz it is
I’m gonna inverse you. Calls, Weeklies, leaps

Nothing personal
This report just says that he bought them in April not that he still has them. If he sold them last week or yesterday we wouldn’t find out until much later

Thanks for the downvotes, does some ape want to tell me why I’m wrong??
it says he bought them then and still have them
Where does it say he still has them? All it says is that the reportable event happened in April and that the report was filed/made public yesterday
>Where does it say he still has them?

in the filling duh
Bitch *where*
[removed]
That’s not how the SEC works. Reports come out months later. Everyone on this sub should know that because of all of Elon’s TWTR and TSLA shit. This report says the event was April which means this was his exact holding in the company on that day. Please cite an SEC source if I am wrong about that
are u blind?
Pretend I am. Please quote and cite it like I am 8 years old because I don’t see it. I want to be wrong
Just sold my puny GME position I've held since 21 and had lost money on to buy an equally puny amount of BBBY. Let's goooo.
lol idiot
My one share in GME turned into four at the split.

I'm sure I can weather the storm.
Damn, your that new type of shill, we can smell a fake ape a mile away.
My ape shit stinks just as much everyone else's.
Dood , yo sold your gme....like that doesn't even register. Sell? Sold? At a huge loss? About to go long? Was long? ..................................................................................... .. .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I literally bought it because of fomo from a dentist's chair at the absolute peak of its price. 

BBBY has already recovered nearly 1/3 of what I lost on my one gme share in the last hour.
My ape shit stinks just as much everyone else's.
Damn, your that new type of shill, we can smell a fake ape a mile away.
Is it too late to move on this?
Your replying to a thread where RC has $60, $70 & $85 calls and your asking if $16 is too late to get in? Are you writing this from the short bus?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
He’s a regard, one of us! One of us!
Is there another kind of bus?
Sell some of your losing stocks to realize a loss. Buy $BBBY. Sell some after you make some quick profit. Relax.
Get the fuck in regard we still have seats open on this short bus
Lol just bought a grand I get paid tomorrow I’ll grab another 2k
In all seriousness I’ll probably be on with moving 10-15 k into this but I still don’t understand why the stock moves.  Again sorry for the dumb questions I’m
Just trying to understand how to better handle this stuff.
Impeccable timing this man has
If he's in I'm in
Hell yea. I'm excited. I want to keep the company and my money.
So he likes the stock?
This is the way.
If he’s in, I’m in
In Cohen we trust
IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN
Made my first investment today, in BBBY! Already up 18%!
BBBY’s cash burn is about $250mm a quarter. They had just $100mm as of 5/31.  Unless they reverse it fast, they’ll be done well before year-end. Or get line-of-credit/new financing.
I question daily how that idiot is a billionaire, his companies only ever lost money👁👄👁
Your Patrick pfp suits your limited intellectual capabilities
All his “investments” have been losing money for years. Even Chewy never turned a profit on his watch.
They could have been profitable if they weren’t going for expansion. 

Lol. You gonna lose
I been watching videos on options so to my understanding whoever owns that option is fked right? The video said people can sell options.
[removed]
Oh wow I see, i didn't think it like that. Thank you so much.

That was last week I’m pretty sure.
“HE CAN’T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!”
He’s the watermelon ducker guy too
If he ducks watermelons, he should have no problem eating out one, and then doing the rind
If you can duck a watermelon you can dodge a ball? :P
Oh yes. Fuck yes duck that melon baby.
Quack Quack, daddy
He doesn't use cum jars he use watermelons
As I found out from someone who commented on my comment. Its Monday
Na I think it’s a different guy
Noyce melons
Why do we not have a Sam Hyde emoji
You know why
Because of what he did to those poor children
u/[deleted] is at it again!
u got an actual rl lol...not a phony one...jus sayn
The guy that offered to gargle someone’s balls comes to mind. It was if gme closed above 40 at eod. Mf closed out at 40.08 lol.
Ah yes, the famous "Ball Gargling Evader"
On PH:
“Investor Boy Hits It Big and Gargles Dudes Balls” - WTF why is this shit popping up. 

On WSB -
Whelp, If this dude doesn’t show us some ball gargling we’re gonna be pissed.
How many times has he promised to eat a watermelon whole??
Wait. He promised to eat "a watermelon whole" or "a whole watermelon"? 

There's a big difference.

This place has changed man.
follow through on what, the post was made last week, not this week, it didn't hit 15 on friday.  just on monday.
Hey man; I’m just here to see if I can force a guy to do dumb shit. Don’t really care if it was all above board. Just like crimes, peer pressure is fun.
He got banned 😆 🤣 currently waiting on watermelon to follow

Excuses excuses
Is he actually a kid? If so should we maybe lower the harassment a bit?
If he's 13 and talking like this we should listen to the little watermelon
Hes 15 I think from a weight loss post he did a few months ago. It would seem that his account is just generally fake because you can't invest at 15.
I'm convinced now that half the people who joined WSB during ape season don't even invest because they're just kids who came here to cry about hedge funds. It all makes sense now.
Yep, and kids love swearing and being weird so they awfully fit in.

We should do what that r/teenagers mod did ages ago where they banned a large number of people and asked their ages to be unbanned. It caught a few groomers and pedophiles out so, assuming kids are stupid, it should work.
You weren’t here a few years ago for the big purge of underage “investors”?
No I wasn't. What happened?
I thought so. It's not a story the WSB mods would tell you.
Kids these days
If you're thinking of the same story I am, /r/drama banned everyone from /r/teenagers from their sub, for being underage, and a bunch came out the woodwork saying "Why was I banned? I'm 30!"
I think that was it.
Good. We need a generation of kids who will hate the rich cocksuckers who have destroyed this country and will be mad and autistic enough to do something about it when they're older. If WSB must be sacrificed to become the breeding ground for this new generation of autistic heroes, then so be it.

These retarded children may be America's last hope.
Don't you have a LARP to be a part of?
I'm gonna be too busy larping up the juice seeping out of your mom's pussy. 🤤
You are 100% underage. I'd say go to r/teenagers but I'm pretty sure there's more creepy millennials playing pretend there than teenagers.
Why can't you invest at 15?
I mean investing as in stock market.

It is unsafe, kids have no idea what they are doing, they usually don't have much money, and it is a lot easier to manipulate stocks with kids. Do you also trust a kid to function in their best interest? They may just think "haha funny meme stock" and crash a company.
"because you can't invest at 15."  


.... have I got a bridge to sell you.
A bet's a bet.

Don't DM him or anything, but make fun of him, absolutely. And ban him if he doesn't pay up.
He has already been banned because he's 15.
If he dies, he dies
And thats.... insensitive.
Sure. And you two have fun at 🌈🐻 camp.
that was last week holy shit you guys are regarded
He did say end of week last week... So he's not liable.
Yeah I don't understand why everybody thinks he suddenly meant this week.
Oliver B full of shit
Apes, follow through. Get this upvoted to the top. 🦍🦍🦍
Why were there so many normal comments moved by the mods? Like "I'm here to support this man"???
You can also see that it says 'posted 5 days ago' which is last week. Unless I'm a retard, you're a retard.
Man can't just come here and profit from this sub without eating that fucking watermelon
> if it hits 20$ EOW you have to eat a watermelon after i fuck it

> Deal.
TIL about Unddit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
That first side bet would be a show
He is a minor and the post is more than a week old.
Mods banned him because he’s a minor lmao
Fucking idiot should have just gotten one of those tiny watermelons.
Right? We've had people drink their own piss over ban bets. This new breed of pussies are no fun.

Back in my day, we had two girls and could only one afford one cup.👴🏻
But the OP made that post last week. It didn’t hit $15 last week…why are people in here expecting an EoW bet to just roll over indefinitely until they get the results they want? This shit is just sad, and u/affectionateguava281 should be put in the dunce corner for misleading everyone.
We found the watermelon guy
beat me to it. (we found em boys!)
I wish I was because that would mean I actually won a bet, but sadly I’m not. There’s a few other people who already found the original OP though if you scroll through the thread.
Sir this is Wendy’s do you not understand how things work? 

Explaining that you don’t actually eat tendies, that your hands are not actual paper and that your wife doesn’t have a boyfriend only makes you look worse.

Please try to keep up with the rest of the retards and apes
Because he stated facts ?
OP is practicing diamond ball chad skills.
The fact he deleted it makes him look guilty![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
is eow mean end of the week
Yeah…*last week*, when the bet was made.
Whatever happened to that guy? He looked like he was filming in some sorta sex dungeon
I'm sure he's probably fucking hookers on a beach in Florida by now.
And jizz
I eat watermelon rind all the time.

Cut that shit into little slivers, add chili, sugar, lime, some fish sauce, Thai seasoning. It tastes like the daikon and carrot on a ban mi sandwich.

Watermelon rind doesn’t have a bad taste or anything. It’s not like carrots and daikon are that different in taste or texture.
This sounds like some psycho shit my guy
Fish sauce. 🤢
Fermented hooker pussy
Do you ever do anything aside from post dumb shit on Reddit with your 3 day account ?
Yeah. Sometimes I fuck your mom just like the twelve million other degenerates in here.
It's probably a bunch of bots. They've realized this community builds hype and fluff through bets. However, they certainly can fulfill them, so they delete. Not always the case, but if this is now common it's worth considering. The bulk of reddit is fake accounts.
Like twitter? We should ask Elon to buy Reddit so they can clear bots and the virgins that work at RobinHood checking for trends
Yeah what the fuck happened to insta-bans for people reneging on their bets‽
We need a mutiny against the mods
It’s not even hard. You just eat the inside and then cook the rind and eat it for dinner. I do it all the time.
I like that shit pickled too.
You eat pickled shit?
n..NO!
For breakfast
Only if it comes in a fart jar
Don't kink shame him.
You never tried it?
Goes well with the watermelon rind
it's good pickled but it's also perfectly good raw !
My husband eat rind consistently and said “it is like cucumbers”. Give him a slice of watermelon and there will be no trash.
Same, at first I did it because I'm too lazy to find a trash can, now it's habit and I like them, like a carrot with the semi-bitter flavor of tart baby greens.
How are your poops?
Just holds it up to the camera to make it look big
That’s an old pornography trick
And it still works
Some tiny watermelons have really thin, edible rinds. I had some at rijks in Amsterdam.
all watermelon rinds are edible lol
Watermelon gummy candy
Eating gummy candy is not an eating an entire watermelon including the rind. Eating a tiny watermelon including the rind is.
What are you,a cop?
You gotta tell us man  it's entrapment if you don't
Maaaaaaaaaaaybe? 🤷‍♂️😘
Well he is retarded
Hey now that’s now how you spell regard![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Rind doesn't even taste bad it just makes your jaw tired as fuck.
Fool should have said no rind. I have to stop myself from eating an entire personal watermelon in the summer.
Those are tennis balls and you're not supposed to eat them.
*Nathan For You has entered the chat.*
Tiny watermelon, AND pickle the rind first to make it taste better. Easiest bet possible!
If anyone mentions watermelon again, it’s him. Matter fact, ban the word watermelon.
watermelon positions or ban
Watermelon futures
This time of year around here we're about to be flooded with excess watermelons on the market. They'll go from 5 bucks each to a dollar a pop on the roadside stands later this month. Bearish on watermelon pricing until late Oct.
Prices might be down but volume will be up. Bullish

Found them?
He has been, for 999 days. Thank you for your cervix.
we need a minimal 2-3 yr old accounts to be allowed to place bets like that. If they gonna delete the account, at least they will need to sacrifice an established one.
...so only allow 2-3 year old accounts to post. Because if anyone else can post, they can make a bet. 

Unless you are proposing a rule on auto banning anyone under 2 years who makes bets
You can post whatever you want but make claims/ bets, it should be a established account so if the claim/bet is wrong, then you better pay up or deal with this sub calling you out.

Here,
The claim/ bet is your call/puts and your account it self is the premium ( if you don’t follow through on your bet).
You didnt get my point. *How do you enforce it?*
With bans? Wtf arent you getting.
[Hm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wphnku/we_must_not_let_him_get_away_with_this/ikijfjx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) If only someone had said that.

My point is he said it like creating a rule would automatically fix a problem that doesnt exist. The real problem is that we need mod follow up to tell us when the person was banned.

And the original comment is talking about deleting accounts, not bans. So maybe go back and check what this conversation is actually about. Not to mention OP thinks deleting an account is enforcible by any method. Not only is that not in the rules, it wasnt in the bet. So I dont know what he is on about.
> My point is he said it like creating a rule would automatically fix a problem that doesnt exist.

Brother what are you talking about. 

There is plainly a problem, people making ban bets without any skin in the game. If you dont think thats a problem then that should be your argument, not that it is unenforceable. 

> And the original comment is talking about deleting accounts, not bans. 

Yes. Deleting accounts is the problem. 

You fix this problem by banning accounts that make bets when they dont fit the criteria. 

> So maybe go back and check what this conversation is actually about

Bruh.
The only enforcible "skin in the game" is a ban. Which is not as bad as deleting an aged account. Your arguement therefore makes no fucking sense. There is absolutely no enforcement on the proposed rule.

Your rules should instead be: no POSTING until your account is at least 2 years old. And potentially bans for bets made by accounts in comments under 2 years of age.

Deleting accounts makes no fucking sense. If they dont go through with a bet, why the fuck would they willingly delete their accounts? Use your damned head.
> Deleting accounts makes no fucking sense. If they dont go through with a bet, why the fuck would they willingly delete their accounts?

I dont know how someone can be so obtuse. 

Nobody is suggesting asking the commenter politely to delete their account. 

OP is suggesting "If you make a ban bet, and your account is less than 2 years old the mods ban your account immediately"

This is a suggested rule that identifies the problem "People attempting to curry Karma and attention without risking anything", and then addresses that  problem in a definable, logical, enforcable way. 

> Your rules should instead be: no POSTING until your account is at least 2 years old. And potentially bans for bets made by accounts in comments under 2 years of age.

Why limit posters who could be adding quality DD or memes to wait 2 years while simultaneously adding ambiguity to rules. 

This is a double negative and doesnt even address the initial problem. 

Give your head a shake.
You are using information not included in the initial comment. He did not say any of that. He may be *suggesting* it but he did not say anything of the sort. It is not my fault OP is bad at communicating.

[I again refer you back to the original comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wphnku/we_must_not_let_him_get_away_with_this/ikgza9b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

[And then back to MY comment where i said exactly what you did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wphnku/we_must_not_let_him_get_away_with_this/ikijfjx?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

[And back to the commenter explicitly stating the account is part of the wager](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wphnku/we_must_not_let_him_get_away_with_this/ikil38r?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

Who here is obtuse?
> You are using information not included in the initial comment. He did not say any of that. He may be suggesting it but he did not say anything of the sort.

oh fuckoff with this goalpost moving shit. 

Okay, so OP didnt expressly say that the mods have to enforce the rule, but who else enforces the rules? 

> Who here is obtuse?

Still you.
Click the fucking links you tool. The goalpost was set and hasnt moved since you jumped into this conversation. 

*who* enforces the rule here is not a part of the conversation. The original commenter said deleting accounts is the risk of making a bet that isnt followed through. It has been repeated MANY TIMES  so far. 

*What he did not explicitly state is that there would be auto bans for accounts under 2 years who make bets* HE NEVER FUCKING SAID THAT.

And just to be clear, though i said it already, he did explicitly state the risk is having to delete your account.

Take the L and fuck off.
> What he did not explicitly state is that there would be auto bans for accounts under 2 years who make bets HE NEVER FUCKING SAID THAT

Not explicitly, but heavily implied in the original comment. 

> we need a minimal 2-3 yr old accounts to be allowed to place bets like that.

What happens to people who violate the rules of the sub? 

Hmmmmm.... Methinks the mods ban them.

It never needs to be expressly stated that he wants the mods to enforce the rules. 

Thats the base assumption. 

To summarize. 

1. OP asks for a rule to stop people making no risk bets. No bets on accounts younger than 2 years. 

2. You say take the rule to an illogical point saying no posting for sub 2 years. 

3. OP says no, that you should be able to post whatever, but that you need to put up an account with some longevity. 

4. You ask how this new rule would be enforced. 

5. I say that it would be enforced like all other rules, with a ban. 

6. *You get all weird about the fact that it isnt expressly stated, despite the fact that its logical conclusion that someone asking for a rule would want it to be enforced by the only people who can enforce the rules in the only way that they can*

^ - We are here.

> Take the L and fuck off.

Bruh.

So, if it’s the FINRA “bell-to-bell” rule the he may owe, per a technicality, otherwise it didn’t hit by EOW last week.
EoW is last Friday, it did not hit

Never appologise for asking questions. It's just a wild, random thing coming from someone posting on an "investing" sub. It's actually kind of perfect that a regard from here is a psychedelic drug user. Makes for an enlightened trading experience.



Also, /r/unclebens
I saw a rad bike and a ferrets penis.
What he does to that poor ferret.... da fuck..
It's a ferrets penis. They get red sometimes because of irritation or chewing.

It's nothing he did to it.
you know an uncomfortable amount about ferret dick
I owned ferrets for a while. Thus I had to care for them and be concerned about general welfare and oddities about their body.

It's no different than knowing about various symptoms of common ailments any pet or person experiences.
Are we sure he's not the one chewing it
What the fuck is he doing in r/teenagers
I can’t speak to that but he looks exactly like someone who’d unironically use the terms ape and diamond hands though
I am a teenager? the whole sub is fucking garbage tho
Get him boys!

I assumed he would be the kind of guy to own a ferret.

I hate being right.
I assumed he didn’t own a ferret but his bedroom probably smells like he has several.

He said 15 eow.  Not 15 before eow. 😅
This will only count if it is one of the “used” water melons…..just sayin.

Out of all the batshit things to say that’s really pretty meh to go back and delete. He’ll have some issues with his gastro later for a bit, but not like biting the head off a chicken or smacking the ass of a horse, etc
Why is everyone going after him? He said if it hit $15 by EoW last week. His bet is safe and he doesn't owe shit.
Il do it, I like the rind.

why are we acting like this is impressive? watermelon rinds are healthy. they taste like slightly tougher cucumber and they're full of citrulline to bring back the morning wood you lost when your wife's boyfriend made you stop sleeping in their bedroom
Good to know
Heck eating the rind isn't a big deal, some of my family members love cucumber rind pickles and I knew a kid who'd eat it straight. 

Tbf you'd probably want an organic one though because pesticides/herbicides are used with the assumption you won't be eating the rind.

Would this be good for those who have Dogecoin and BBBY in their portfolios? Is Elon behind the latest Dogecoin uptrends? What do you think?

In before this guy ends up in one of ChubbyEmus videos, the rind may contain salmonella (no joke), guys be careful what you wish upon this being, if he are to go with the bet, then clean that watermelon rind with soap before opening it (still, no joke).
You can pickle the rind and eat it. And its really good. This guy is a pussy. I will do it for 10 bucks

Watermelon

Because 90% of a watermelon's weight is water, it's one of the best fruits to eat if you're trying to lose weight. A 100-gram serving contains only 30 calories, but a full watermelon is >1300 calories. It's also a great source of an amino acid called arginine, which helps burn fat quickly.

Only taxable if you sell
PULL OUT MY GOD
Pulling out is for paper bitches
If you yolo 2 mil you’re either retarded or have a lot more money, so a 2x isn’t enough of an adrenaline rush.

Either way god speed retard!
This is true. Wish I had balls like this to yolo so much. Hopefully some day!
I’m more in the boat where i wish I had 2 mil.

Please send moneyz
Pull out half?
Hold it a year for long term cap gainz duhhhh
Found Ken's account
Which you are certainly going to do
Well what happened to the 10,000 shares that you held then? They didn't magically disappear. I assumed you sold them to buy more BBBY!
I think I love you
[removed]
Same, but for adult films.

Now I'm here.
$100 at 11
It’s a safe bet, not 100% certain but like 99.5%
Win some lose some.   Don’t get too high or two low
Dont tell me you already sold. My calls and shares are going nuclear Lol
10 shares at 11.64 let's goooooo
110 @ $6.06.  I feel like a genius right now LOLOLOL
20 @ 5.06$ 

Mix feeling between genius and retard to not takes more haha
I would have gotten more but my extra money goes to GME, I just saw RC like BBBY and his buy in was WAYYYYYYY above the price at the time.  I was irritated when it dropped below $5 but I'm happy now lol
Same reflection haha. Main account on gme hehe
20 @ 5.06$ 

Mix feeling between genius and retard to not takes more haha

Yes i am!
YOU DID IT!!! YOU SOLD ASTS FOR BBBY! YOU FUCKING RULE!!
It worked out nicely
Congrats, happy for you!
Thank you kindly
i always see your comment on wsb.
Donate some wins to a retard foundation or something when it’s all over
Retardation helps the retarded
I bought some useless kitchen junk there last night to support you. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

I just dumped 2k into stocks. Waiting for my other 1k to clear so I can buy call options. Hopefully it don’t go too ape shit before I can buy some. LFG 🔥🔥🔥🔥

This whale owns almost 2 one thousandths of the entire company! That's ~0.2%
Baby whale*
Fuck you and Congrats! I'm swimming in your wake and enjoying the ride with 1500shares. 

HODL, no cell, no sell. The price is wrong.
Only loser don’t buy BBBY!
Nobody puts BaBBY in the corner.
Dont sell fellow ape, HODL and get 5 mill ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
4.75M Did you predict 5M today?  Incredible.   However, I kind of like the guy below and his prediction even more
Bruh if you hit 5 million, can I have some? For... research purposes.
I believe BBBY will go to 100 and above, and i think it will go to atleast $35 by the end of the week. But the 5 mill guess was not for today, it was overall :D
I’d rather see nothing but 200 Mill
I really hope that you do!!! Honestly i do!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
You better not dump it if you make a small gain
Agreed.  In the not too distant future,, $20 may look like a bargain.  It’s all about perspective I suppose
!remindme 1 month
why does a 0 stock still show in your portfolio ?
Just sold it this AM
This stock has the potential to go parabolic!
I put $500 in at $11.35, and another 200 at 9.20, just put up another $300 last night at 15.85, hoping for the absolute best
It should be known I’m about to start grad school and this was a lot of what I had, it might not be the tens of thousands of gain porn some people are posting, but it’s the world for me
OP you gunna sell now that it’s over $27….?
/r/TheRaceTo10Million contender!
I'm 100% sure that you feel like an idiot holding ETFs rn
That's it letting go of these AMC bags if it means more BBBY.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Congrats, and Fuck You
hodl the line babyyy
nice dudeee
115 shares at $6.15, LFG!

To the moon my friend , join up this ain’t over yet
God are you there? Please help me use my few shares to ride this to Valhalla
I transferred 20k to my brokerage yesterday bit was too afraid to out it all in. 
Got 100 shares at 16.15 then about an hour later it dipped a bit so I bought another 200 at 1590 or so. REALLY wishing I would've put everything I had in
Just tried putting the rest in and order wouldn't fill
This guy is gonna have $10M worth of $BBBY by EOD
It just was stopped halted
Please i beg take profits
Good ultimate plan.  However timing is everything.  This seems like the beginning not the end
I wish you luck!!! Any chance you looking for a step bro?
You are right coz it hasn't reached ATH but history doesn't always repeat it self
History never repeats itself because the participants of the present (should) already know the past ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
But there are so many oblivious people you could say there are only two type of people out there... players and well NPC's
Damn, If I am this rich, I would blow it first to Hookers and escorts, drugs and other illegal things. Good thing I am not this rich
Short squeezes like this usually end in a quick crash back down. I would highly suggest selling 25-30% of your shares to lock in profit and ride the rest to the moon.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Papa I’m Winning!
Which app are you people using?
Cs
K folks calls ITM should be exercised right? Not sold to close? That will force short sellers to deliver shares and pump price more correct?

Feel like how everyone exercises/closes winning call options will have a big impact but looking for confirmation
Sounds good
I mean ya, if you can afford to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 

Most can’t
When is proof coming? The perfectly round numbers are always gonna look sketchy. If it’s real then godspeed regard.

BBBY is my portfolio
🚀💎👏🏽
Same
This.
The whole ship could be PLTR honestly
Sprinkle a lot of BB too
I sold my BB at a loss and bought BBBY. I've recouped my lost money several times over
GABAGOOOOOL!
Ova here!
Fuckin genius
Hello mirror, looking good.
and a dash of UWMC and DKNG 💀
I got out of PLTR, -did a Kathy,  took all of the money and put into BBBY.

Best call ive made in a long time. Rip it off like a bandaid.

Wealthier than ever now too.
Ditto, that wound healed a hell of a lot faster this way.
Or silver
You too? I sold PLTR for BBBY. It will be such a relief when I break even soon.
Lmao me too!
*you guys have other stocks in your portfolio?*
yea lol anyone who hasnt sold everything and bought it all in on BBBY is missing out
Yep. Sold my failed meme stonks this morning and bought BBBY.
heck yea!
Best one ive seen yet
I was all in.

Found $1000 in an old retirement account. Used it to start trading.

Put it all on Bobby at $10.30

Sold it today at $27.

Walking away with $2500.

If you can, hodl. I'm walking with more than double my money on my first trade ever. I feel like asking for more is asking to lose.
Buy back in on the dip mate
I did. Like a regard. I am one of you, I think.
As long as you bought in at a cheaper price it’s fine 😅

I sold all my TSLA for this
Yeah. I sold at 27 and bought at 24. Trying to sell again at 28 if we get there again.
Will there even be another dip jesus
Sure when NYSE is halting again 🗯
go out to work. a week 2000 a week. no risk. lol
Lol I'm a .net developer, bro. I'm good on the job front.
I bought at 15 what shud i do im at 100 profit
Man give me 5 minutes I need some post nut clarity right now
I do all my trades during post nut clarity
everything is red in my portfolio but BBBY. even those robo-managed ETF crap . I knew we were smarter than robots
I doubled my portfolio in two days on BBBY.

Easiest money I ever made. Still holding, brace for 80 dollars a share boys and gals.

Btw, whats your opinion of the porsche 718 ? Thinking of picking one up after we are done here. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
Are you thinking the Spyder, Cayman, or Boxster?
I can't believe BBBY is at $25.  I am almost double my original investment.  Holy smokes.  Last week one guy threw $100k into it, am sure he is now at near $260k
You have a portfolio???
Don’t forget to take profits. I just took some profits at 120% gain. Like, put it into perspective that’s fucking awesome lol. It could go up more, sure, but it could also go down again.
I had 250 shares at an average cost basis of around $6.50. Sold 100 yesterday at $15. Sold 25 a few minutes ago at $24.90. Locked in gains... now ready to hold and see where this thing goes.

Edit: I have 25 shares in Fidelity and 100 are DRSed.
I bought a whopping 10 shares @ 4.70. Sold 3 to cover it. Now I'm all green.
Exactly the right approach. You’ve made absolutely mental gains already and now you’ve got fun money in there. Like, it’s as sensible as meme stock investing goes lol
Same
Truth
Very true
Love this.
Bro literally
bbby 💎🤲💎🤲🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀
Is it still going up??
currently at $25.13. peaked at $28 but its still early. bbby to the moon💎🤲💎🤲🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕
What’s “the rest of my portfolio” mean
All in 😎
😂 everything is in BBBY. The only reason it’s not showing 100% is that they don’t count options
This is so fucking accurate for me :(
Up a grand from 2 hours of trading stocks (danke)
Finally in the green YTD lol
Lmao so true, after a year of holding various stocks I'm finally making money
Robinhood seems to have started pausing trading? Or is this normal? Stocks doing great then trading pauses and now it plummets? T
Yup. Crime.
They’ve already been fined for it, can’t believe they dare keep doing it smh..
Well halts are a little different than removing the buy button, but doesn’t mean it’s right
Did t realise the poster conflated the two, I’m not on RH. 

Halts are perfectly fine and healthy, and only Nasdaq/OMX can decide to halt a stock, which is for legitimate reasons.
Hahaha LETS FEAST
Are you me?
This morning mij wallet: -$430
Now: -$320
Fubo! 🚀 👨‍🚀 🚀 👨‍🚀
MARGE!? Is that you??? GME hault also![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
This was genuinely funny.
I so happy
All green in mine, though yes $BBBY is the Jack pulling the ship!
$BBBY $NVTA let’s go!
Real speaks the real ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Will it peak a new high?
What is Theta?
lost 98% on wmt puts (my first ever yolo, about 40% of my portfolio when i entered the position) this morning and am still green on the day
So effin true 😂😂
Why is PLBY so cheap ?
Anyone at 28 lol
You have a rest of the portfolio?
I only got two shares i purchased them yesterday and im up 100$ when can i sell? Whats the target? I dont know what im doing i got a warning last time for selling to early am i supposed to wait two days?
For real. Lmk
The rest of your portfolio is a tax deduction for bbby
Sole 20$ CC's yesterday. Rip.
Literally my FAZE position, already sold all my position and I'm greenish than ever, I'll never tell people to not buy bbby again since they saved two times already, I hope every retail investor make money and don't get left with bags, rooting for you guys
Only bought 4 shares because I'm a broke bitch boy and im already regretting not buying more at 11usd I'm a fuckn pinecone
When I bought in at 5$ but only bought one share for funsies.  Fuck me.
We should al tweet elon musk helped out with gme
Fucming liberally. Just brought me 100k out the red for the year. God bless regards
In 2 days I've regained everything I lost last year and now it's all profits. Can't wait to gamble them away again.
Down is up

Crossing a line there.
Yeah man that’s taking it too far
Go back to /pol/ you absolute animal.
This guy chose violence
We get it, someone hurt you when you were a child.
FBI, this guy right here. He’s the reason everything is wrong in this world. Please arrest and waterboard him until we get answers.

You monster.![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
WTAF?!?
Load all your nicest non-stainless knives also
Now this is the reason I'm here.
I'm buying just so this guy gets fired
I’m buying so this guys boss gets piss
I heard his boss is buying for that exact same reason
I heard the HR dept is chipping in as well
HR hates this one trick...
Now THATS the way
Piss based gain porn is the reason I follow r/wallstreetbets
“Piss Based Gain Porn” is what I named my daughter!
OP's buying just so he doesn't care if he gets fired.
I’m buying 2000 more tmr so he quits
Retard alert! I'm all in. Let's flip this to 100$
I'm buying to go piss on this guys bosses desk.
Same
[I'm just here so I don't get fined.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmABbHSOTqQ)
He probably makes enough to quit his job at $65 and just wants to piss on his bosses desk, respectable
Fuck it another $15k in BBBY. Lfg mfs![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Irretardless
Plot Twist: OP's self-employed.
Came here to say this.

He's a real Johnny Son of a Bitch
His wife’s boyfriend is the real boss and he’s pissin’ on his wife right now. I’m buying so you can get payback.
Oooh. His boss is his wife’s bull. Got it
Pissing on his wife?  If she’s a lying whore he must be Donald trump the fucktard.
Plot plot twist: he always pisses himself
Plop plot a lot: he is the desk of his boss!
Plot twist, after the assault and battery/ sex registry OP ends up working at wendys to pay off legal fees. I work behind it, so will confirm when the time comes.
The plot thickens.
The plop thickens.

He is now pooping on himself.
😂😂😂
That means the watermelon is a go
F a watermelon on the boss desk.
Plot Twist: OP is unemployed
Plot double twist: boss is into piss-kink
If shoving a watermelon up my own ass is illegal though, I WILL start a riot.

Can’t tell if we like the stock or just want to see these dudes be absolute degenerates on camera.
I’m just excited to see R Kelly’s latest video

I bought more just because of this post
Let's get regarded in here
Is this a squeez or a pump? I hope me asking isn’t a sign of topping out…. Good luck fellow hopetards!
It's a pump for now, but it can quickly escalate into a squeeze. That would be hilarious ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
If we do this I can die content
Dude.. this is Jordan Belforts wet dream..  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🍻🍻🍻🍻

I thought he going piss on his boss.   He means pissing on his mom home desk.
EXACTLY! Enough with these dorks trying to fuck watermelons.
This guy fucks.... But you better provide proof bro or complete ban
Expect a video fucking delivered on a dvd to your house with my fucking dick in it pissing on a bearded man and his desk
Dvd is yesterday. Blu ray dude. Or ask nflix to stream 4k ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Set up an only fans and make WSB degens subscribe
If bbby hits 65 I'l def sub to that shit.
This is the way. Turn those tendies into tendies + like... $35? $40?
I don't think OF allows piss anymore
It’s only gonna be up for a day I’m sure he can get away with it
How do you know? What are you into my guy?
HD DVD all the fuckin way you degenerates
jeez have some pride, it has to be released on Betamax
Wasn’t Betamax that fat white japanese michelan man?
Underrated comment
Can I pay for this OF with my bbby?
Calls on WSB only fans.
Prob more like 3 1/2 K
Nextflix is always looking for quality original content.
This would make a new video market for NFLX and then WSB can share future stunts for the world to know.
> nflix

Netflix is yesterday... Disney is the future...
Thumb drive and urine sample.
I Could see nextflix buying the story
Have you guys heard of CDs?
CD is CoinDase?![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Can't wait for that gain porn

I have 123 shares cause I can’t afford any more 😢
Bruh you gonna quit your job and retire on $5k hahaha you are regarded
Hahaha.  Came here looking for this.  So basically this isnt even gonna pay for the bail money.  

Classic WSB right here.
Oh my god this is wonderful. Ya I figured OP buddy would have a couple mill @ $65 to do this
123 shares…..let’s poll 10.5k on wsb and get a video anyway
I figured at least 5 or 6 figures…bruh isn’t even pulling in 8k *before* taxes. Some people truly are blessed with such polished brains.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
My wife’s boyfriend shall provide 🫡
I figured you had 100 $20 calls or some shit lmfao
If I did I’d make a bet saying hits $65 and I’ll flood the entire building by bursting a sewage pipe
damn bro u got me hyped up over like a 1000$ bet lmaooo
This is awesone!! Man I hope it hits 65 so we can watch this ruin his life for $5000!!!!
This reminds me of that joke in the movie "From Dusk till Dawn"
[removed]
100%
This is going to be awesome
‘Stream’ it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I only accept VHS.
I want an NFT of it
You better not flake out like that watermelon eating pussy
DVD's are so 2010. make it an NFT
I hope you get banned for saying nft
Can we have a comment track as well?
I want mine on lazer disc
Can I have it on fucking Hi8?
Oh good, I’m not really keen on pee, but if your dick’s in the footage I’m all in.
r/thisguythisguys
Like Reddit ban. Not just this sub. The entire site.
Plot twist. He's self employed.
So we’re all going to watch a self-inflicted golden shower? Ok
I’m still in
"Behold my parabolic power!!"
Well this 10 year old better start growing  a beard.
Or his Dad is his boss.
*daddy
Nah you’re fucked ☹️
Hahaha
This is what I come here for
👆
If it hits $65 by EOW I will also piss on my bosses desk even though he’s a really nice guy. He’s also my wife’s boyfriend
Ban Bet
If it hits $65 EOW I’ll also piss on your bosses desk
If it hits $65 I will roll around on the pee on your bosses desk 🚀 LFG
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You have my piss
And my bow
If it hits $65 EOW, I will piss on the boss
This is the type of shit that makes me check reddit everyday
I almost hate how good Reddit is fuck Lmfaoo
If it hits 17.25 I'll have his boss piss on me while OP pisses on the desk.
Fuck pissing on the boss or his desk.  I'll piss on his bed
Fuck that, I’ll take a shit on his desk!
OP needs to tell us where he works so we can join in.
I also choose this guy’s bosses’ desk
What will it have to hit to piss on your boss?
$65.01
Because of this I just withdrew my whole savings and upped my shares of $BBBY 🚀
My $20 calls will be sexual.
So is mine!
My single 8 dollar call will look pretty neat
wow...that's a new one....
If BBBY hits $65 EOW, I'll piss on your boss's desk too.
You want to do it anyway! Finding an extra incentive
If BBBY hit $65 EOW ill get a tattoo of a bathtub
This is why I’m here to see regarded stuff like this
Bring a watermelon with you
ILL SHOVE THE WATERMELON UP MY BOSSES ASS
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
I get the impression that you really don't like your boss
He's self-employed.
It maybe he really does "like" his boss...
All these wild ass bets happening, I mean short of impregnating a watermelon this would be interesting as well.
I’ll be honest, I believed this would happen until you added the edit. I don’t buy it. 

Still, good luck!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
If it hits $100 EOW, drop a fat steamer on his desk
I’ll do it for $100 eow bro
Imma be real for a second here bro.  If you do either the pissing on your bosses desk or drop a deuce on it, film it, and upload it somewhere, you may be the catalyst that brings wall street to its knees.  In other words, a legend.  Here's how:  if you do this and explain why you did it you'll go viral.  That will bring the attention of the plebs to the squeeze.  They'll pile in and send BBBY to the motherfuckin Andromeda galaxy.  YOU will go down in history as the man who changed society forever.   Plus, you'll probably make more money off the video than your 123 shares.  Do it guy.  Be the legend you were always meant to be.
2donuts4elephants i thorough appreciate your support on this upcoming adventure. Although I am genuinely terrified I may have to piss on my bosses desk and he’ll be confused as fuck cause it’ll come outta nowhere on a Tuesday at lunch time I would be honoured to send BBBY to fucking uganda and a half. I say thanks from the bottom of my heart for your support I love you 2donuts4elephants.
This is the way
If BBBY hits $65 EOW I’ll use the desk as a cutting board for that other guys watermelon.
Plot twist: he works for his dad
A dump on the keyboard would also be highly effective.

💩⌨
I can’t shit on demand bro come on
Not with that attitude
Extend taco tuesday through thursday

Profit
I'll shit on demand for you. Clinched cheeks for ribbon effect? Or spread em for the logs?
Ugggg....2 guys and a keyboard..
Why should girls with cups have all the fun !? 😂
Now this I wanna see, not the watermelon!
samesies, but not the piss.
My employee did it to me when it hit $10. 
That’s why I’m here.
I will piss on my desk if we hit $65 end of week I need to keep my job because kids in college and that shit is expensive even with regarded money
So everyone is holding their piss and I been wasting mine in the toilet 🚻?
I’ll take the gourd futures
I knew BBBY was gonna be like gamestop the first time I read that guy on here posted his calls
Which one?
Is it too late to get bbby? Had it at 10.20 and sold at 11.40 last Friday 

Will it die soon or are we colonizing mars?
Your bags can get checked on Mars with mine
Highly regarded
If it hits 65 I’ll pet my cat against the fur
Golden shower has now replaced watermelon p0rn and plungers.
Me too, your bosses desk
This is the WSB I remember. Let’s gooo!!!
[deleted]
Means smart investor hodl diamond hands smahtguy
If BBBY hits $20 by EOW I’ll cash app 400 apes so they can get 4 for $4 on me from Wendy’s 🍔😂
Gunna be hard to spend all the cash with a sex offenders register you fucking nitwit
This is your boss’s boss You’re fired
This is the boss’s boss’s boss. You’re fired, he’s promoted!
Are water fountains going exist?
Rotten. I'm here for it
Make it $69
Don’t get stage fright 🚀🚀🚀
Jeez I really hope those 30 shares pay off, where I’m from that’s what I wipe my ass with.
Please also put for my day at work
Whip it and piss it for regarded OP god speed you magnificent bastard
I love you sandvicheater
And you will use that money for lawyers ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
A free plane ticket to piss on a desk…I'm just gonna say it. This guy fucks. Am I right? 'Cause I'm looking at the rest of you guys, and this is the guy in the house doing all the fucking. Am I right? You know I'm right. This guy fucks.
I love you bro
Okay, I'd have to see a video of you singing "Pee On You," two forms of government ID, a police officer there to verify the whole thing, four or five of my buddies and Neal taking notes, and your grandma to confirm your identity.
I too will piss on your bosses desk.
Would you drop a duece on the way out.
Let’s get REGARDED HA! LETS GET REGARDED IN HERE!!!!!!!

Pretty sure you’ll get arrested for pissing on your bosses desk but at least you’ll have bail money.
Boss better bring the poncho it’s gonna be raining BBBY money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Not buying this one, wouldn't have the balls to do it
And if it hits $65 I will go to bed bath and beyond and stick a plunger up my ass!
An most likely go to jail 😂
Regarded?
Restarted any better for you?
Doesn’t make much sense either way. I think retarded is probably the word you’re looking for. Hope you can piss on this mfs desk tho
If BBBY hits 650 EOY I will livestream the entire process from training flexibility all the way to sucking myself to completion
I’m buying to see u and fellow regarded 🦍 take a 💦 on ur shitty boss 🏓
If it hits $65 EOW, I’ll piss on your bosses desk too.
No u wont
Why stop there? Take a shit too.
Enjoy your ban!
Take a shit on his desk and smear it on his face!!  Legend.
Now this gives me a tendy erection
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You'll likely need bond money in your pocket fyi
He says he has like 120 shares. Dude isnt even gonna be able to afford bail...lol
If BBBY hits $65 I’ll suck my bosses dick
/r/selfsuck
I'm buying for the legal edit because that was gold
No cap u/yomommatoosexy this is a great way to fuck up your life even if you end up as a multimillionaire, the sex offender list is no joke and that shit is permanent.
Sounds like you’re talking from experience. Hmmmmmmmm I already said I would I can’t go back now ☹️
Lmao we both know you wouldn’t go through with it anyways lil pussy boi
This is fairly unimportant, and I’m sure it differs from state to state, and is often discretional, but there’s almost no chance you’d have to register as a sex offender for pissing on your boss’s desk.
Shoving a watermelon up his ass may be illegal, but so is pissing on his desk. You may as well do both.
Wait hold up mods I wanna see this.
I bought a share at 14.21![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
THIS GIY OWNS THE WHOLE FLOAT
GODSPEED
Why do i have a feeling you're self employed
This is why I browse this fucking subreddit. OP better not disappoint if we hit 65.
Anon's boss probably: "I was wanting to promote you anon, I was just waiting for you to show some initiative... Now that you pulled off that hilarious pissy desk prank I see you have what it takes anon! The position is yours if you want it."
8m Account no he wont do it, just like the melon retard
I bought a few for you.
yes yes and then you delete your account.
I’m buying all in for this
I wanna piss on his desk too
I'm pretty sure you'll go to jail for that bro, but as long as you say sorry and slap a thou on his desk it'll be fine.
Holy fuck I'm in. Fly me to the Moon BBBY!
I'll join you to piss on his desk
Just bought my first ever 45 shares just to help this tardigrade achieve his desk fantasy. RELEASE THE PISS ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)
Self-employed?
A well regarded gentleman indeed
OP is the hero we deserve in these troubled times.
This is the way
Why not piss on your boss?
If it hits 65 I’ll hold OPs weiner while he pisses on boss desk
Aggressive.  I like it.
!remindMe 5 days
I will gladly piss on your boss’s desk
Truly retired!
Yeah yeah, you’ll piss on your bosses desk, then lose all your profits betting on dumbass options and end up behind Wendy’s where you were always destined to be.  Hope you have a soft mouth, more profit that way.
I’ll suck your dick @ wendys for $65 on Friday at 4pm 🥺
There’s you go double booking again, I know for a fact you’ve booked my brother at that same time slot….I’m in!!!!
Plot twist, his boss is the manager at Wendy's.
U mean retarded* ?
If something that’s never gonna happen, happens, then I’ll do something I never have to follow through with too. What fun!
More teenagers making empty promises I presume.
antiwork joins regards?

or

regards going antiwork?
I will harass my cat if it hits 35/share
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)Fuck did the cat do to you ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Not put it’s life savings in BBBY.
True
It's a cat. Cats do shit all the time!
Ok, this is gettin good. I’m out at $45 either way but🍿
I’ll drink my
Own diarrhea

Wtf..🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
grossss
You sir are one broken individual!! And my play money is being deposited tomorrow around noon, Let’s fuckin go baby!!!
I'm not touching BBBY with a 10-foot pole.
Touch these nuts w a 10 foot pole 🙂
Yesssssssir, do it!!!
Awfully thoughtful of you to give your boss something to wank to before you go
RemindMe! 4.2 months
Legend
I usually skip this part of the video
Are we taking a little trinkle or a full on office pond?
I’ll drink 9 litres of fucking water 1.5 hours prior
💦🌊
Be careful with the second half of the bet. No need to catch a charge over some retarted apes. Ok actually forget what I said. SHOVE IT ELBOW DEEP!
Dude... If it hits 65$ I'm gonna piss on his desk too
If it hits 60 your boss is going to piss on you. He told us earlier in discord
Positions or ban
Bro I fucking said I have 123 shares cause I’m poor
Man I really hope I’m not this guy’s boss
Whats your name?
Ken Griffin, I run a little mom and pop shop called Citadel.
Nah bro but I’ll still piss on your desk if you want
I think I’m good thanks but I still hope we hit $65 EOW.
😢
Hey if it’s any consolation you can still piss on your boss’ desk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
YES, entertain me!
I’ll piss on your boss for $40
I’ll fucking give you $40 to piss on my boss
Show me the money!
You will post a video?
100%
Always the classy posts on WSB
[deleted]
Don’t be a pussy piss on his desk
Can I send a bottle of piss? I don’t know the legality of such things as sending human waste, but I too would like to take part in pissing on boss’s desk.
Are you too poop shy to take a dump on their desk?
If this hits $65 EOW I'll piss on you while you piss on your bosses desk. Also, you'll pay for my flight and lodging for this, ok?
Motherfucker why you gotta piss on me piss on my boss and we cross streams
This the content I joined the sub for. BBBY to the 🌚!
You're leaving the basement to piss in your mom's desk?
Buying calls tomorrow…
Plot twist: his boss is his wife
My wife’s boyfriend
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Remind Me! August 20 2022
buy me a ticket and i’ll provide refreshments BBBY 🚀🚀
I’m buying 2500 shares tomorrow to hedge on getting my employee piss on my desk
Hell I’ll take that bet, I could use the 25k my call options would give me
Fuck it me too
[removed]
Man I don’t have enough in but $65 end of week not fucking end of year
This is a bad plan.
Golden showers for all when it hits $85.
If I had more shares I would join you tards but I still need to afford crayons after this run.
Guess I’m buying more tomorrow
Is this really going anywhere?
I hope this happens…and then this guy welches and everybody chases him around Reddit that the guy who said he would gargle balls. 

P.S. did that guy gargle balls or get banned?
That’s the spirit!!!
Pretty sure the pissing falls under the same law as noncon melon sodomizing.
You were going to do that anyways. Let's be real
Fairly certain pissing on the desk may be illegal too unless noone sees your naughty bits than youre probably good in anycase wishing you the best in your goal cuz fuck bosses amirite
I'm self employed, but if OP delivers I'll piss on my own desk if BBBY hits 65 EOW. 

Fuck it, I needed a new desk anyway.
Hit me with your best shot (OP when he does it)
Make sure to record your epic “I Quit” video
You make under 100k a year for sure
Plane ticket is great and all but how about bail money too?
What is it with so many guys on here wanting to shit and piss and have things in their butts? Y’all need to calm down haha
Plot twist:

Your boss secretly crushes on you anyways.
I'd be honored to come piss on your bosses desk with you
Mods! Proof or ban!
We want you to shit on his chest
I hope you have a lot of deep ITM contracts
I’ve already spent the 300k I’m planning on collecting on Thursday
Most likely you will piss on your pants .
That’s only $1800 for me so i think I’ll sell. But let us know how it goes.
This is how you inspire people to keep buying more BBBY!
Yeah man you better up that to shitting
Its been a bit since I've yolod some cash. Im buying in premarket.
I'll legit take a shit on his desk for ya lol

Drink only moonshine at least 12 hours before pulling this stunt. Have a lighter handy. Burn that desk.

If it hits 66 EOW, I'll happily piss on you and your boss!
Ban bet?
I am drinking gallons of water, so I'll be ready...

Fuck it, I’m in
Screw commercial. We will send a jet to pick people up. No joke.
Just plz lock your investments + profits and leave a baggy for moon
I will do a head stand whilst also pissing on his desk
Hitting and holding $25 is when the big squeeze could happen🚀
Remind me Monday!
My $38 weeklies would be so happy
Ha!!  I knew I’d find you here!!  I loaded up today. 
If BBBY hits $65 by EOW, I’ll piss on my desk with you!
Going all in. We need a video of that pi tho
I like my boss. I'd probably just quiet quit
That's all the DD I need
Do it now to establish dominance for later pissings
I take it your wife’s boyfriend is already pissing on her huh?
You broke ass will buy a single share after reading that
Ban bet
Well now I have to buy BBBY to see this happen
I'm in, plane tickets or ban at $65
I might just buy those 45cs that expire Friday because these are the types of bets that hit the hardest!

Well, this is a good enough DD for me. I'm gonna buy some shares.
This is beautiful.

High quality WSB content
R Kelly his old ass. Piss on em good.
Are we not saying retarded anymore? Or is it a layered joke that we’re too retarded to spell retarded?

*Editing to say I’m a literal (Neuropsych tested) autist.    And this is a genuine question. lol.
Kind regards my friend
Finally someone speaking my kind of language
Wait..........am I too late to get pissed on??? Or was that not what we're doin??? 😐
It sounds like you should piss on your bosses desk anyway.
This is the best

I wish to be on this list. Don't lie to me
If it hits 65 eow I will walk into work and pie my boss in the face and record it just for u
Dude you’re insane
Someone save his username and we will get this
This is the reason this sub is great.
I already did it
Lol
Ok, so Friday it closes at 64… what’s our consolation prize?
status: unemployed

no boss to piss.
ONE OF US
you had me at piss 🥰🥰🥰🥰
This guy gets it
I’d like to shit on this guys bosses desk 💩
Should I buy it tomorrow, thx
!remindme1week
Finally a good post
the twist is the guy has a 200k job but only owns 10 shares of bbby
#youwont
I want tht plane ticket homie
What would the market cap have to be to reach $65/share anyways?
Can you piss on everyone’s boss?
With all due regard. You truly are a retard. God speed.

So i guess that means we gotta buy more
Slap my name on that list
Deal!
Good DD. You Son of a Bitch, I'm In.
🎵Lets get regarded in here…🎵
My guy, im buying so i can com and piss on your boss desk add mein
So is this going on the hub or?
I hope you do and he stands up and knocks a few of your fucking teeth out.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)

“Gonna get this fucker fired if it’s the last thing I do…”
LIKE A BOSS
I was here
if not you drink
I also choose this guy’s boss
Now that’s why you are a kid; just know that this chat is the evidence of your premeditated murder of your bosses desk and perhaps the judge will award your boss all the money that drove you to the pissing crime. Make your money and buy the company and hire your boss
Loaded on calls and shares, let’s quit.
regarded please.  yes.
Order placed just to see this happen.
I hope you have a brother who’s a really good lawyer.
Spread to Twitter!

BBBY TAKE OVER CHALLENGES TESLA FOR A HIGHER PRICE — WHAT WILL ELON DO NEXT?
No you won't and this post was for hype.
No deleting your account now!
Mods should have a holding account for anyone that makes bets if they fail to deliver banning isn't enough

You want to show out put the fuck up
I will buy my own ticket. Let’s go!
I'm in.
It's probably also illegal to piss on the desk as well
Haven’t been here for a couple days, is regarded the new term or is op just bad at proof reading
I lost my ass on seasonal gourds.
Why don't you just get everyone to send you bottles of piss to pour on your bosses desk? By the end of the week some will be ripe
I just gotta take a piss somewhere.
I hope you will not be that one guy who deleted his account when BBBY hit 15$.
That is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. Film yourself pissing AND shitting on his desk when he isn't there but leave a note saying "Your kindness repaid in full". Sign it. 

Extend the date to 8/26 for foregoing a lawsuit.
Gonna buy some premarket and at market. Don’t believe in the squeeze too much but wanna help this crowdfund to make it happen.
Remindme! 5 days
Has the dreaded R word been banned? So many people saying regarded recently
And exactly because of people like OP, karma will prevent BBBY to reach that levels.
Ban this idiot for making fake ban bets he can never actually honor without doing prison time.
Positions or ban
Man if it hits $69 i'm getting a rocketship tattoo on my right ass cheek
If it hits $65 I'll wash the dishes...
Send proof
Ahhhh fck this im in
Someone get his address in case he deletes his account !
I hope for a 25-35. I’ll be happy with that.
Bet or Ban

Common guys wait till I get paid.
How about taking a dump?
His boss is his mom…
rofl
Best regard
rooting for you to get fired
If it hits 100$, I travel to Moscow to meet up with the Trump Golden Shower girls.
Wait can we not say the R word anymore? That’s like our thing
Lettttssss goooooooo
this is actually hilarious and I'd want to see it
Retarding your second edit, pretty sure it’s illegal to piss on your bosses desk too.
We need more epic quitting work videos.
Hope op makes the news.
Good god. I am so proud of people like you, the retardation to not only buy a stock because everyone else buys it but to really just fucking piss on your bosses desk because you FUCKING MADE IT!!!!!!

Breaking News: A boss of pissonme company grabs the employee that pissed on his desk by the neck and made him lick his own piss from the table. 

Here is the video
Just tell me when you are ready to piss I'm joining in. Just need the the flying tickets cause I have to fly a bit
DD says buy more, got it
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
So will the boss be at the desk while you are urinating on said desk?
gOdSpEeD![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Gourde futures are great, but if you want to be truly regarded… have you heard of DRSing GME?
I mean you legally can not piss on his desk either but yolo
Nit even 1 year on reddit ..
Is there a timeframe to positions or ban?
I'll join in. Your boss cant fire me, i dont work for that retard and im going to be set with the 10k im set to make.
So you're gonna lose your job for $600?
oh WSB never fails to dissapoint
He’s his own boss
I like to go and piss yo boss’s desk. Lmk
!remindme 6 days
just make sure they aren't there or you'll probably be breaking a few laws there like assault and indecent exposure(which could then get you labeled as a sex offender for life lol)
Someone screenshot this please
hahahah go on retard we will wait 🥰🥰
FYI: Any boss worth their salt will have their desk on a slight tilt for this very reason so make sure to either start at the top or fully bladder up beforehand.
Yeah yeah yeah whatever.

If it hits 70, I’ll shit on their desk.
IM GOING TO AMERICA! to piss on someone’s bosses desk!
You mean if you win the lottery?
Be sure to cover your parts, being a millionaire on the sex offender registry won’t be cool.
At 65 I’d just sell my bags
Just bought £200, it’s not a lot but it’s all I can give towards the cause brother 🫡
yeah maybe having a little rowdy fun should stop just before getting put on the sex offenders list for life bruh
If BBBY hits this price by EOW I’m going to the club and getting bottle service and making the letters the girls bring sparkle BBBY
Wait so you didn't even buy calls? Just shares? LOL
To the moon 🚀🚀🚀
OP is dumb and saying this for nothing. Idiot bought 123 shares and not calls. So tf.
I'm afraid of the fomo and following blindly
#NU $NU BANK  🤙🚀🤩

I’ll shit In my bosses laptop and close it like a waffle press
Pleasepleaseplease  go to 65$ fuck the money I just want to see this please god dear lord
These guys complain about the sub quality being low since meme stocks, i think it's the meme stocks that bring this sub to life.
Um, i think you look for a new job regardless of where BBBY ends up EOW.
I would love to piss and possibly shot on your boss’ desk.
You better remember me
I’ll fuckin, I’ll fuckin, sew your ass hole shut and keep feedin ya, and feeding ya, and feeding ya

Save some URINE FOR ME, I JUST BOUGHT 100 SHARES
gourd futures?  how about both gme and bbby shares.  we support Ryan Cohen not gourds.  I assume you all understand after bbby we using funds to buy more GME.

also we want watermelon pics. 

gg
I’m adding another 100 for this guy
It's getting re7arded up in here.
You should start a BBBY pool with your co workers.
If this isn’t a sign to take profits I don’t know what is 🫡
That's not a shitpost. It's a pisspost.
I am confused. Op will piss on their bosses desk, but shit post. Omg its impossible to finger this out. What the cuck does it mean.
If BBBY hits $65 EOW I'll become an unripe watermelon
Let’s all go piss at the desk
!remindme 24h
Self employed work from home ppl are crazy.
Hey, you that *I'll eat a while watermelon* guy if BBBY HITS 15?
I bought "
C 33 8/19 maybe I'll held that bbby for a few days
You all really will just go out of your way to be the bag holders every time. GME, AMC, CLOV, BBBY….
Amanda fans join chat. Flair checks out.
Shit just got out of hand. If he doesn't shove the melon up his boss's ass, he has to put it up his ass instead. Wallstreetbets is out for blood and we can't let these users get away with fake promises.
As someone who also hated his boss, I suggest banging a hooker on his desk first to assert dominance, then pissing on it to show ownership.
Vid or it didn’t happen
This is the content I like
I feel weird buying more shares just for that reason. But fuck the OP’s boss
I love you
😘
Hell, If it hits $65 EOW I’ll walk into my job, clock in, jump on top of the customer service desk and quit over the store’s PA system, then calmly clock out.
I want regarded money! Whatever that is!
Best one yet! This I’d actually like to see
Shit on Debra’s desk.   Like a boss.
Who the fuck is debra
Let's get regourded?
LMFAOOOOOO
Now I just need express to move.
Do bosses even have desks at Wendys?
Remind me Friday 8/20/2022
Now this is a true YOLO
You better not delete your account like the watermelon bitch
This is just what we needed after watermelon eating guy deleted his account like a fucking pussy.  
Sir I am going to buy some more today just to get us closer to you pissing on your bosses desk!
If it hits 65 EOW I'll do something relatively mild because I don't have the stones to put something in my ass.
Dumb shit
Meh..... Melon Kunis is way more appealing than this
Buy more 10 shares.
Not a lot but I help how I can
Posts like these are ghey and unrealistic. Karma whore
My hero
Fuck it Im in
Oh damn, I in. Gotta see this.
How much do you have invested in bbby?
-_-
Every now and then I just comment on a thread to say EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! ALL OF YOU!!!!
Please.  Get real
Somebody is self employed with an onlyfans account! Where can one get the link to your watermelon up your own ass video.

Calm down. PULLBACKS ARE BULLISH!!!

We are going higher. MUCH MUCH HIGHER......
woooo!!!
to $60 by next week they said michael cowen bought calls at 60
Easily. I personally wont even consider selling before we reach 80. And even then I will hold on longer. I dont see it outside the realm of possibility that we reach 200 dollars a share here. 160 dollars a share, I can also see happening.

This is the easiest money we are ever going to make. Free money, and wallstreet is paying for all our drinks.

History being written boys and gals! BULLISH ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)
hell yeaa!!! wooo!
im really hoping for at least $100, but 200 would be AMAZING.

$27!
28
If this guy actually fucks a watermelon bbby is going to $90

Aaaaand we are halted
Honestly good, I needed a break to clean up all this cum
28$!!!
Halted at 28 holy cow
I did some DD and I found that the stock should go way higher.  
First, as part of any great DD, I looked at BBBY’s stock price in June, around $6 per share. Then I used the internet to check what web traffic BBBY had in July compared to June. About 41M visitors to their webpage, up from 38M in June. That’s an 8% increase. More web traffic = More customers = More revenue = Higher stock price. Makes sense.  
Then I looked at how many people that downloads BBBY’s mobile app (because converting app users to real clients that spend money is tight). Up from around 1,800 daily downloads in June to 3,000 in July. That’s an 72% increase!  
Then I looked at how many followers BBBY has on Facebook. Towel-buying people loves Facebook and guess what!? 8,000 new followers since June, a modest increase of 0.3%.  
And last but not least, and this is when it gets really advanced, I compared the number of mentions on Reddit in June to the start of August. Because reddit mentions = higher stock price. BBBY was mentioned around 50 times per day in June BUT 3,000 times per day in the last week. That’s an increase of 5900%.  
Now, if I know anything about percentages, it is that you add them all up. So 8% + 72% + 0.3% + 5900%. That’s an increase in 5980.3%!!  
So you take the percentage increase of 5980.3% \* $6 and you get what the stock is really worth - $365!  
**TLDR**: I did the math and BBBY should be worth $365 per share. It’s basic math sheeple.
and to think i was almost afraid to buy more at 16 this morning
So far
Lol ez
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
Can’t believe it
Hey, I'm in for 230 shares as well. Cheers Ape!
🚀
Its gonna go way higher than this buddy. But its nice seeing my portfolio double in a day.

With that said - PULLBACKS ARE BULLISH. Dont forget that. People taking profits at 28 dollars is a good thing. We're going to speed through 30 and 35 next.

&#x200B;

HOLD.
HAHHAA, ITS OVER FOR YOU ALL! I bought some, so it will inevitably fall now!
we knocking on $30 now
Old news buddy

I am so glad I found you stupid apes!!  Went heavy on the bbby and I can’t thank you enough!!!
New price target: boss desk pissing

Ich bin traurig 😟
Wo kann ich in Deutschland am besten den heftigsten hebel oder irgendwas in richtung US options kaufen?
Kredit aufnehmen
Und dann wo rein ?
Steht im Titel
Is illegal, zumindest in ö. Bezweifle dass es in d anders is
Es gibt keine deutschen Broker die das anbieten, außer du bist bereit die Kosten selbst zu tragen.

Wenn du optionen kaufen willst, eignet sich interactive Broker am besten dafür.
Optionen bei IB Resellern, also z.B. Lynx.
Interactive Brokers
ibrk dann kannst du einfach direkt mit us optionen ~~dein ganzes geld verlieren~~ handeln
thanks for sharing.
 I read "banks are scared of us BBBY apes"

I buy more BBBY to give banks' nightmares.

Buy more BBBY!
Watch out we got a bad *** over here

Edit: Ass
You can swear on the internet, it’s allowed. I’d venture to say it’s encouraged here.
Well fuck
De bunghole
Dutch isn’t German
Can't see the screenshots for some reason.

I live just north of you, in Denmark. I can see options fine in my broker (Saxo bank).
interesting could not find them, neither on onvista, market screener, goldman sachs, wallstreet online... nothing. But good for you buy all you can!
Do you have options or "Optionsscheine" (english translation Warrants) those are not the same.
It's options, not warrants. From what i can tell, Saxo does not trade warrants, but will execute them, if a customer has them.
German hookers still allow anal though
Had the same issue on Saxo (Denmark) when BBBY was at 6USD - no idea if it was a glitch or lack of supply. Bought shares instead.
I was wrong.
You have to differentiate between options and warrants like knock out certificates.

knock out certificates are illegal in the US but common practise in Europe. It also has basically not really much to do with the broker, since its only about the question if the broker lets you trade it. But since the banks publish those certificates like Knock out certificates or faktor certificates you would find them on Onvista or GS or marktscreener or Godmode Trader etc... if those sites dont find them there are none. No matter if your broker is Interactive Broker, Trade Republic, Capital, smartbroker or what so ever.

I use smartbroker and i generally find all sorts of derivatives. Smartbroker lets you trade more then 1.5 Million derivatives from 16 issuers but you wont find any derivative for BBBY at smartbroker. Thats my case and there is nothing misleading about that.

[https://smartbroker.de/derivate](https://smartbroker.de/derivate)

Update: glad we agree :)
Great DD I ape in 🦍
Normally ain’t like this but TO THE MOON MFS
CFDs are cool. You can lose money faster 👌
Puts are printing
Some guy from Germany said it was BBY in Germany and not BBBY(after I corrected someone), was he just fucking with me?
he was fucking with you its BBBY or BBY.F if you wanna trade it at the Frankfurt stock exhchange or BBY.DE if you want to trade it at Xerta. If you just go BBY in germany alone, that would be Best Buy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Who said Germans don't a sense of humour.
No. I Said it (maybe others too). Google „bed bath & beyond Aktie“ and you’ll see. But we normally use wkn (securities identification code).

Edit: or isin as the international wkn
Wkn is: 884304

ISN is: US0758961009

But first: You dont really use ticker symbols in Germany therefore you have WKN or ISN

Secoundly: If you type in BBBY you always get Bed Bath and Beyond

But if you type in BBY you either get Best buy or some other shit as i will show you here:

could not post screenshots in this reply otherwise I would have done it
Yes I know. Xetra uses Bby for example. But like you said: Germany doesn’t really use it so you get wrong results in the different contexts
Xerta would be BBY.DE if we want to stay correct here. But yes we are thinking the same. I tried to find derivatives on BBBY with WKN and ISN too like I showed at the screenshots provided anyways.
Hasta mein sheizer
You should consider using a real broker such as interactive Brokers 
[here a picture of the options chain for BBBY](https://i.imgur.com/WP1501k.jpg)
Nien! Unt shnickendoddle!

Edit: translation: buy the dip retard.
Wenn du keine Hebelprodukte auf BBBY finden kannst, gab es sie vor 4 Wochen auch noch nicht.

Verfallstag ist Freitag und die Emittenten können die Produkte ja nicht verschwinden lassen. 

BBBY ist ähnlich zu Steinhoff (Umsatz, Gewinn, MK) und auf Steinhoff gibt's auch sehr selten Derivate. 

Insofern ist die Tatsache, dass es in Deutschland keine Derivate gibt kein Hinweis auf garnichts.
hast du den Post überhaupt gelesen? Es gibt zig derivate zu ähnlich großen Firmen wie zum Beispiel Media and Games invest. 

Ob es ein Derivat gibt oder nicht liegt in der Regel auch schlichtweg am Interesse an solchen Derivaten. 

Nun da es hierbei nun offensichtlich nicht am Interesse liegen kann wenn nun nach wochenlangem Hype immernoch kein einziger von über 20 Emittenten ein Derivat zu deieser Aktie rausbringt, bedeutet dies, dass sich keiner traut mit dieser Aktie als Counterpart in welche Richtung auch immer zu traden. Das und nichts weiter hab ich gesagt.
Die wissen schon warum.... Finde es im Vergleich zu den Optionen in US lächerlich dass wir solche Möglichkeiten, mit einem normalen Broker, nicht haben.
Vollidiot
Well there is capital.com cfd, leverage 30:1with 2% margin.
Donkey shit
schize to de moon! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
After a close look at all your screenshots my suggestion is to add more lines to really prove your point and confuse me completely
Just tried options. The whole chain above $24 (to $39) has no counterpart so you can't buy them
Wunderbar
They don't want to bet against a bunch of retards.  Can you blame them?  We could do ANYTHING!  The more retarded the better.  You want to bet your bank on a roll of the dice?
12 million degenerates, they should be scared
There are no option legs above 35 for Sept and Nov!
Stop buying those fucking Scam-Scheine anyway. What you see it what the banks do everytime, the iV goes up on them. They stop trading in them. It's not even illeagal. Read the prospectus for those things, they hold all the right, you as the consumer have NONE. Warrants are forbidden for retailers in the US  for a reason.
to the mars!
Limit of 500 CFDs on T212 as well I think
Riechst du was Der Felsen kocht?
It's cause Germans aren't stupid...except that one time where they did that thing
What about interactive brokers? They should be available in germany...don't they offer options on bbby?
GameStop is still my #1 but BBBY took #2 fs
Since we’re not US citizens, you can’t make calls in Germany on BBBY anyway
nothing to do with citizenship lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Well afaik you can’t buy calls in US stock as German because otherwise you could  circumvent the 15% withholding tax on stock, hence you can only buy low leverage calls or buys
No, you just have to go to a broker that does not sit's in Germany, and allows German customers. That pretty much boils down to IBKR, or Tastytrade. But otherwise you can absolutly buy, and sell stocks, and real options on US-Exchanges.

You just have to do your taxes yourself, and can't rely on your broker to them for you.
Thanks for the info!

Go low as me. 10$ turned into 14$ just this week
Jesus dude save some for the rest of us
Lambos or nothing baby! Except it's not lambos
Only a half cooked lamb stake at best
Lambo hot wheels
You basically made back .0005% of what you lost the previous week ! A wins a win
I turned 100 into 140 and will be ordering wings with pizza tonight thanks to this sub
Don't forget the tax man
I don’t pay taxes I am a sovereign citizen
I knew a guy who was a sovereign citizen and thought the law didn't apply to him. He ended up murdering some pregnant woman and burning her house down and he's in jail for life now. Kinda put me off the whole idea
#IgnorenceIsBli$$$!!!!
$4.67 let’s go !
Same. Less than 24 hours. Just add a few zeros.
Agreed. I only have 3 shares but this is the most gains my smooth brain has ever comprehended!
HA! I'M AT 23 BABYYYYY
I bought more today although I bought at 10,20.
I do not take advices from a 6 days old account.
Why not? Shills give the best advice.
When in doubt, always yolo.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
when in doubt - pull out ~~from watermelon~~
You already know how it works. If you buy, it goes down. If you hold off, it moons. Since you are going to be wrong no matter what - at least be wrong trying to get rich $$
Toss 4K and regret it wasn’t 20k
damnit this makes so much sense! get rich or die trying!
85 cents' song after inflation
YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU
this guy gets it, never a truer word spoken - YOLO time!!
Then why bother accruing it if apparently it doesn't matter to you?
I’m so weak this is exactly me the last hour as I scroll through Reddit. I’m literally thinking of yoling tom
Earlier you yolo the better 🤙
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
It’s going to 🌙 bro, this shit is shorted to fuck. Something something not financial advise, am regard.
Price target: up
Do it. Last year I Yolo’d into GME at $100 before it kept going higher. I kept thinking how crazy it was that I jumped in after it had gone up like $90 already.
I’d say the smooth phase of constantly being green is over and we’re entering insane volatility phase. Will it moon or will it go down the shitter; nobody knows but it’s provocative and it gets the people going
been burnt 18th time lets do 19th time now ... stay bag holder till 5 years to turn green
Don't worry OP only been here for 5 days.
Will my WISH bags get green in 5 years then with 11$ cost basis?
Cries in CLOV
I still have confidence they will do well. They are growing rapidly. Once they cut the fat and don't need to do marketing it may be quite profitable
only if Ryan Cohen buys in.  

GME hodlers will then bless you in Ryan Cohen we trust . otherwise RIP.  99% of pump and dump plays will die if you buy in fomo.
Yeah my 13$ wish will take a decade to turn like my pton, sndl, etc
Maaan I thought I was regarded, but you have gone full regards! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
But this one’s different
Very different indeed!
Yes, just like every one of those he bought in the last 18 months 😂😂
Got to have big regards to think this is similar to those stocks if GME actually ramped and you have no idea how BBBY and GME are connected and are relying purely on wsb reposts for your hard earned cash
![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)
Im just saying when gme squoze many people ate their words. Why is that offensive to talk about lol? Same people who shit on a stock are then quiet when it moons, it happens, why should i be forbidden from pointing out how you folks exist ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

edit: ah i see where the hateful passion comes from, he or she was left holding PLTR

DOUBLE ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

When pain ruins your sentiment, it clouds judgement. Losing money is equally as valid as mooning. If you only believe one thing, you are just a shell of what your logic and character once was. Rest in empty wallets, fellow ape. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
PLTR seemed sooooo shady when it happened. I stayed far and clear from that mess and was glad I did. Sucks for those who believed it, but it had some crazy strong scam vibes going on
I know this was a joke, but it really does feel different for this one
It was, but it does. Haven’t seen all of WSB on 1 ticker since GME. Which split into like 7 meme stocks shortly after, but still. This is insane. Full ported yesterday cuz of that thesis alone. It’s just getting so much fucking attention right now
>tocks shor

yah im excited to see where this goes, it really does feel like everyone is narrowed in on one stock too. Glad that Robinhood is under fire and investigated now, they can't pull that BS that they did back then too, that was the only thing that halted the momentum back then
If you get in low enough, it’s hard to get burn 😂
That's why I bought it at $4.50 and sold at $16 🤷 people be getting greedy but I'll still cheer y'all on if it keeps going up.
thanks remember to donate to Ryan Cohen would not be made possible without chairman of GME.
Cramer says go for puts ... So that's 100 💯🙏 our way .. inverse Cramer all day AMEN ❤️?
Do it.
I haven’t felt this alive since Jan 2021… $BBBY is bae…
SIR THIS IS A CASINO
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.
Suspiciously sound advice for this forum
I agree with u/G0R1L1A you should leave
That's the thing: they're following your advice, investing 0$ and gambling 27k$ of loans.
Sounds too reasonable.. I think I found a shill guys ? Ban! Lmao
Dogshit??? Isn’t GameStop outperforming the broader market by 60%??? While they naked short the shit out of it everyday. Crawl back into your Mayo hole Kenny
I bought WISH at 14
I don't get this.

How do you not at least make a little money on a run? Like, the first time you see a ticker mentioned a couple times just grab 1-2. Sure you won't make a lot but cashing out $1 profit a few days later is better than training yourself to buy late and sell later.

The moment you saw BBBY being talked about, it was around $5. You could have gotten in then, and not been burned. Then it closed at $8 that week. You could have gotten in then and not been burned. Then the following Monday. And all last week. 

But instead, after like 14 days of upwards trading, *now* you're starting to consider it? Most of the runs in this sub go like 3-7 days max. If your trading instincts only key-in after two weeks of upward momentum, you need to spend more time learning to pay attention to sentiment my guy.

Buy Low Sell High < Buy Early Leave Early
You kinda answered why now OP and others are considering versus a week ago.

This easily could be only a few days thing but this seems a bit different.

I personally missed GME but have been burned by PLTR and SOFI .

This seems like it has enough support and momentum to be a mini GME but for all I or anyone else knows it could crash tomorrow. Hesitation isn’t unreasonable.
Yeah GME went a hell of a lot longer than a 3-7 day run. I don't think things are short lived as some of the people on the sub tend to make it. This does have different momentum behind it, the others, it just wasn't the same for me personally. 

I am going to put an okay amount in at a decent price and planning on building my position over the next month or so.
We’re degenerates here. I’m not swinging the bat hoping to earn a fucking McDouble.. I either have nothing or Kenneth Griffins yacht gas money at least.
I desperately don't want to buy the top on one of these again...
The longer you wait the more that chance increases lmfaooo
It’s not the top. Lol. Not even close. 

I thought I’ll just buy more when Cohen starts the MOASS… but this bitch BBBY is running away before I’ve bought more
Limp in with some limit buys, can always dive in when it dips temporarily today.
Rock on FAM ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
Lmao life questions…
the FOMO is about to kick in.. get ready to 🚀🚀
msm is silent on it.
gme was everywhere last time. youtube, twitter, fb live stream comments. so far i havent seen that much hype. only here.
The moment I buy, we all burn. I'll sit this one out for the boys
Buy now, ask questions later
keep wondering bud, we're up 60%
Know it's common here to yolo and stuff but don't risk putting yourself in a hole. I got a small amount and I've been reading other people's sell point and I'm going slightly lower to be "safer". If it goes up more I'll be happy for everyone involved but im just some mostly broke dude who works his life away I'm not gonna risk more than I can lose.
What would you consider a good sell point?
40-50
Me: played puts and calls on clov made money on both plays then dumps all of it on $Prog calls loses it all 😂😂😂.

Sometimes I make smart trades then the degen in me comes out 🥺
No that's pretty much just the way casino works ain't it?  Never mind options that are engineered to depreciate, even with gambling of a constant odds of 50/50, your net worth will be an irregular wave that infinitely approaches a "zero sum game", but where the math never fails, eventually there will be one time where your networth passes the point of zero.  The math will continue just fine but in reality your bets end there and you have to leave the table.
If you're really having issues with FOMO then just buy a pathetic amount. If it moons, great, you bought a ticket for a fun ride, no you won't make even a meaningful amount of money but you won't be stressing either at the more likely outcome, and youll probably reduce FOMO a bit aswell.

People talking about serious amounts of money... life savings and all.... in this sub.... the absurdity is intoxicating.
I semi YOLO.  Does that mean I have two lives or live twice…. Wait…or died twice?
If you believe in reincarnation then YOLO is BS. I like Carpe Diem better, seize the day! But might as well YOLO in your current life, because you may be born into a post- apocalyptic world in your next life.
This one has a different but familiar scent
I was wondering the same thing at 9 12 and 15. Bought in at 15 because it keeps going up. 1st day no burn yet. Smart man I am.
Buy stock in watermelons for when BBBY goes to $43
I sincerely hope you went short on BBBY last week.
Absolute FUD via a bad meme
![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)
‘this time its different’
RC still holding his $80 Jan Calls. He didn't sell them when they were crazy green the first run up. I'm pretty comfortable with this particular meme stock.
If it's popular on wsb, you're already too late
Nah dude get out of here, it’s just beginning I’m buying more shares every day!!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
Unless it reaches escape velocity and exits WSB to reach general retail, but apparently no one has any money left anyway so I guess it wouldn't matter.
Its been popular on here since $8. Stop trying to push this shit narrative. The more people know about it the higher it will go.
Shut up hedgie! 😂 It’s not to late for you to cover! 🦸🏿‍♂️
Me right now wondering if I should take a 700 dollar loss on gme in an attempt to yolo bbby to make that back and maybe more?
lmao 700 loss on GME?

how are you not making money on GME if you were constantly DCA? and buying the whole float/total shares?

I am a XXXX hodler of GME we support BBBY WSB pump mainly because Ryan Cohen is there else there is no play.  you need to thank Ryan Cohen if BBBY is good.  IF you are just here for a pump and dump then. gg you will lose.

Pay your respects to GME hodlers as they are the ones that enabled you to even have a chance using BBBY.  The constant spamming that GME hodlers sold to buy BBBY on youtube is irritating as OBV says otherwise. so that is a big no.

if you sell gme to buy BBBY it means you taking off your foot on the HF neck and now they are free to FUK you over.  Show that HF on the ground you can hold his neck down with your foot and buy bbby with your other foot. holding down both HF if you can that is.
Hard to make a dumber financial move than this. Godspeed regard.
This is the way
Just keep in mind, a short squeeze doesn't do anything to an actual company. If they file for bankruptcy you still lose regardless of how high the stock goes.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

Whats up shortie
What is Tom Hiddleston doing in that painting
This time is the charm ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
I mean what do you have to lose? - Trump
I'm gonna say probably not.
Take what you can afford to lose. Then if it tanks you survive. If it moons you have cash but regrets for not going all in. Just remember as you wait it’s going up.
Do it. What do you have to lose?
Buy.
Probably
If you’re buying now, it’s too late, but I may be wrong
don't. There is no way of knowing. Just accept you missed this one and move on. There will be other plays and this shit could tank at any moment.
Snooze and lose
I had a 6$ buy-in position and sold at 10$ when it had a little dip, thinking it would go back to 6$. Now my buy in is at 12$ hoping it will keep going up. Am I doing this right?
5$ turned to 15$ ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
I think this is Kenny’s personal assistant’s account
Shill
If you think you missed the boat then pass. Spend what you can afford to lose. Good luck!
Ah yes, a 7 day old account talking about all the meme stocks he bought in the last 18 months, yeeeeeeeeeeeeahhhh, GTFO of here Cramer
Is it meme or me me?
Of course you will get torched.
seriousness vs degen yolos if you bought at 4.5 dollars use house money. ride the wave.  personally speaking?  pump and dump plays by GME hodlers would just go back into GME. DONE.

Especially since pump and dump youtube channels spamming that people leaving GME for bbby? UM how bout no?  BBBY pump mainly cause Ryan Cohen > AA of AMC

clearly.
Before you buy in, let me get some puts real quick.
The time for that was weeks ago when there was first a whisper. By the time people are on their third day of discussion, providing it isn't the weekend, it is too late.
FOMO is never the answer
Fomo
The less time you spend thinking about it the more likely you're in early enough to not get burnt. Then you gotta hold your nerve. I bought at 22.5 but averaged down.
Ryan.....mutha.....fuckin.....Cohen.  which other WSB bags is he holding? There's only 2
Go all in this is the only way
Just do it!
I dropped a paycheck this morning on it. 65 shares BBBY!
It's different this time
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
ONLY TWO HAVE RC! The winners
Probably
This is essentially a circlejerk sub. If you're getting your financial advice from here you'll go bust no matter what. If you already know you're a retard, then put most of your money in something your grandma would buy like a world ETF and gamble with the rest. I have 5% of my money in BBBY right now and I already feel pretty stupid.
Imagine seeing a repeat of GME and AMC and not yoloing with the rest of the apes. This is the easiest trade I've ever made.

Why do you hate money?
It's going to 80 at least to hit father Cohen's calls
Eargo buy 1000%
Bbby up up
the longer you contemplate, the higher the buy-in price
I’m like Whalburg in the gambler movie - keep doubling until something comes in…. Yet to work but got to work just once he he
We are still early 🙏
lol this is me. I am not willing to buy more than 100 shares of this. I was kicking myself that I didn't just spend 12 grand when it was 12 bucks and I noticed it, but I just can't do it. I put my portfolio into Google/AAPL like a boomer.
My faith is in RC. Motherfucker knows something is up. No one buys $80 calls when the share price was $15. 

Price might bounce around in the mean time but I have no doubt it'll close above 80 sooner than later. 

Not financial advice. Just my own retarded thoughts.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP Auntbeckie1968!!! POLICE ARE ENROUTE! PREPARE TO BE BOOKED FOR PROVIDING ILLEGAL FINANCIAL ADVICE!

![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
7 day account I totally believe you with that low effort retard AI created meme.  Buy a few shares see what happens takes less effort than posting here.
The volume of discussion on this is higher and the jump has been more intense like GME. 

IMO it’s worth it. I’ve got 93 stocks at $16 

Plus I wanna see that guy piss on his boss’ desk
Yes. To both of these.
You were supposed to FOMO in at $9, or even 12.

If you’re only starting to think about it now I don’t know what to tell you.
Can't win if you don't play.
Up 60%+ I hope you did
You only got burned because you sold. My GME shares are looking nice right now
I unfortunately bought wish a while ago at $5….
I'm kicking myself rn for being too poor to buy the calls I wanted last week for like $200. It's $1800 as of typing and climbing rapidly. Big sad.
Same 😢
I started buying in the $4s but not much cause I have trust issues. Today I YOLOd in at $26. FML
PLTR MOON WEN?
how bout never or when cathie wood sells everything XD

maybe when Ryan Cohen takes over and kicks BCG consultants out.
Sounds like you’re the dogshit
Well, that didn’t age well ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Never chase
I'm starting to lean toward this holding some value like gme... but the store is so bad... full of Karen.
That seems to consistently spike in the holidays....for a decent reason. There's a shit load of perfect gift ideas for the Karen in your family all located in the  store

True ape!
Anyone else remember the 420 sell wall that WSB users had placed just for shits and giggles only for their orders to execute premarket ?

Pepperidge farms remembers.
I tried for a few mins just trying to get a screen of 420.
I remember some guy who did and tried to fomo back in, only to be saved by the disabled buy button. I sometimes wonder if he's off slamming hookers and snorting cocaine everyday, or lost everything chasing after every p&d stocks that was touted as the "next GME".
he's fucking watermelons.  they don't charge by the hour.
they give the best rind jobs
this man knows his produce.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
And money won’t change his kinks, only make em worse….*stares at leathered and chained  watermelon*
You know he lost everything.  Gamblers can’t stop gambling.
[deleted]
[I’m gambling again!](https://youtu.be/hPQQsvNUksw&t=162)
Even when they're up enough to quit?? Like, even once they finally made it, don't need work no more, kids college is paid for, house paid off, etc etc etc, even then they dont stop?
No, because then they start shooting for Lambos and yachts.
Ughhhh. So it's not a rational mind thing, it's almost like a disease. 

Same w alcohol. Some people drink and stop np. But some can't ever stop i guess.
Let’s be real he lost it all
Dude went on tilt started slamming cocaine and snorting hookers. Full tilt
He lost it all, surely. So do most sheep in this sub.
Sheep? Man what's the hell's wrong with you? We are apes! 🦍
4chan has entered the chat
I wish I would have had that $420 sell order placed 😂
That shit dropped so quickly after that

😭
Didn’t it bounce off $450, basically? Straight past $420.69 for a few glorious minutes and then halted all the way back down to 80.
$483 was the highest buy I saw.
Correct⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
483 was a hit n drop back to 420 then kept goin down. I missed gme back then! Ughhhhh. 

But I didn't miss on the BBBY train tho, BABEE! BBBY- up up up up up up up! Go go go go go!😎
Bagholder spotted.

One dude sold market orders for 2000 something.

I understand why they stopped the machine from turning because we were about to nuke the entire market into bits and pieces. GME would have gone astronomical. Hundreds of thousands of dollars potential, the buy orders were too much. They had to stop the wheel. You would think they would never put themselves into the same position again by going short beyond float but I guess these guys are absolute retards. I don't have much to put in but I did buy 5.91 at 16.01
They should have been made to pay like €3k a share or something to close out the short positions though. Instead they were allowed to short again from the top while retail buying was switched off. Highway robbery and a big mistake.
Literally true.  Imagine if WSB nuked the global stock market, started a massive depression and triggered WWIII turning the world into some kind of mad max dystopia (rather than allowing that to occur naturally over the next few years).
How would that be WSB's fault? WSB was playing by the rules.
Well, i liked the comment so here's your thumbs up! 👍 Keep up the good work!😉😁
Right back at ya!
Yup my automatic sell for 10 shares triggered at that amount cuz my coworker suggested it cuz he lurks here. I bought em at 12$ I think
I did but I raised it morning of the 28th. Figured I'd grab an extra $100 or so per share. Oh well..
76million shares outstanding for GME then. BBBY has almost 80million shares outstanding today.
80 = 76 so BBBY = GME

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Pew-pew
Diamond hands rule applies also
80>76 so BBBY>GME
oh shit, you might be right.
EX POINT!😃😃
*On the books*

Reality was close to 200M outstanding for GME

God knows how much more it is now after 1.5 years of piling on more shorts.
Except BBBY has something stupid like 101% ownership between institutions and insiders. Every one of us ret~~ards~~ail investors is just fanning the flames.
Close enough!!
Those lucky few
Schrute Farms®️ remembers too
They sold almost at the top , I sold like half at $500 during premarket which was the absolute top.
Dude I was looking at that driving to work, didn't sell.....
Lol I did not go into school that whole week because I was making a semesters tuition in a day.
And now? Working at Wendy’s huh?
No, just finally finishing school with a nice savings.
Hehe! That is so sweet! Very lucky! I hate what Robinhood did😠😡🤬🤬

Maybe BBBY can do what Gamestop was able to do... plus some! 🤣😉 that'd be nice n sweet for damn sure!😉
500 premarket. That’s when I learned the screen shot rule… good enough for screenshot. Take the gains.
I like that rule
During market I got 499.98 sells on half my shares, which was around the peak fidelity price if not the peak
I had 69 shares at 420 for my top.
positions or ban
That was so long ago I dunno if I can show it anymore.  But I still have my other shares at computershare.  I think 273 atm.
I sold 8 shares for $400 each while we were locked out.
[deleted]
who buys meme stonks on compushare more proof needed now
I sold at 410 made like 70k usd in one week one of the most fun weeks of my life.
Proof or ban?
paperhanded bitch
Lmfao

I’m out the loop - why do ppl mention Pepperidge farm in this context?
Can anyone explain to a retard why GME historical data doesn't show a price above $100?
The split.

100 would show as 25.
August 19th EOD AMC dividend. APE

The Same day a 5-10% bonus for holding 3-100k for half the month of July until is rewarded into your brokerage account on none other than Robinhood.

The only stipulation, don’t move it anywhere...

Feels an awful lot like Being in an American movie theatre

Watching the Gamestop on Wall Street

And now we can do it from our Bed Bath & Beyond![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
I have a picture of the trade execution for a single 420 share saved somewhere on my desktop. Ought to frame that shit. Fun times.
69th upvote
[deleted]
you mean if you have an account at a regular broker like TDA and not some bullshit like robinhood
So what was the ramification of that? Did they not still sell at the top albeit pre-market?
And those were the winners
I deleted my 420.69 to set a $1,000 sell. That was legit retirement price and it would have hit, too. Fucking Robinhood.


But I also probably would have got greedy and deleted the $1,000 sell anyway and put it to $6,904.20 and lost a bunch anyway.
$420.69 to be exact 🤣
😂wsb is so glorious
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
420.69 flashing like a college girl on spring break.
Yes
420? Bro people bought $800-$900 CALLS on GME for like June of 2020 lmao
I made it in time and removed my $420.69 sell order :)  
Could have bought a house. But I still managed to be in the good, so all is fine.
Remember the dude who sold calls and got margin called and tried to sue DFV? Wonder what ever happened to that guy 🤔
Dude I had a 420.69 limit order set with 667 shares. Avg price around $60, maybe less. I canceled it at $380 because apes told me to. The next day the button was disabled
Happened to AMC at 69.
Ya I remember those were crazy times lol
Fuck it. You convinced me. Why do I need $655? Take it.
Yup - currently have 93 shares at $16.
I paper handed twice at a much better cost basis. I’m sticking to this investment and letting it ride. I salute you regards.
I sold what's left of my WKHS and WISH shares at the giant loss I deserve for being a FOMO riding bag holding dumbass and put that into bbby at $8. 

I only need bbby to hit ~$50 to break even and erase my all previous meme stock failures so let's go rocket ship.
Hodling for you my dude. We all moon together 🚀
This comment is so golden

I lost money fomoing into meme stocks so let me sell at a major loss and fomo into a meme stock 😂
Timing is everything but we will see. This is a casino after all isn't it?

Edit: Also I held on WISH and WKHS for quite a while, I don't think either had any future at this point.
Wish is such an appropriate name.
Lmfao are you me?
Same I’m erasing a CLNE loss (hopefully)
I was still holding my CLNE since it wasn't down nearly as much, but I've since thrown it in the bbby pot, got that chunk at $16 this morning bringing my avg to $12 lol.
Waiting for BBBY to hit $50 is the stuff that’ll make you hold a bag on this stock too
Just keep thinking about those $60 & $80 calls RC is in.
That’s quite the price target.. Godspeed regard![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)
Lmfao are you me?
Just waiting for Jim Cramer to open that hole in his mouth and spew shit about BBBY.. that’ll be the signal for all retards!!
Lol he already has been preaching to sell. It’s time
Wait the FUD master flex Cramer is trash talking our Bae BBBY?!? Ayyyyy that means it’s about to pump HArD AF![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)

Income the FoMo
About to go pick some up now
Up to 19$ as of reading this inverse Cramer strikes again!
True research right here! Going balls deep now!
Fuck it. $10k BBBY YOLO mfs
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
If you think it is too late, buy more. Common sense is inverted on this sub
Wheres cramer when you need him.
Well, he’s been on CNBC & Twitter saying to sell BBBY, including today.

THERE’s your inversion! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
There is no better strategy I know of than inversing Cramer.
He did call the bottom. 

Kathy sold the bottom and is still batting 100
For now. Remind me in 90 days
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Lol
At some point Cramer will Wreck Us if we don’t stay on top of the mirror’s.


The old bags likely know we inverse him on demand.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
ok that means im gonna buy BBBY cos inverse cramer usually makes money
[He said Short Sellers were fools not to take profit on BBBY](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1559351576761962498?s=21&t=T7rQ6H4ChEg3YHX7KdBCAw)

[Also](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1559351753900019718?s=21&t=T7rQ6H4ChEg3YHX7KdBCAw)

That implies he thinks retail should BUY BBBY

I was planning on doubling my BBBY position today but now my inverse Cramer instinct wants to set stop losses instead.
He’s only a tear drop away. Probably.
Don't buy![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
Look at the account you replied to. It’s a karma farming bot - this entire thread is full of them. This is an orchestrated pump.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
I thought I was an idiot when I bought a small bag on Friday at $12.73. Turns out, I am an idiot still, just a lucky one.
The question is will I be an idiot buying in for the first time tomorrow. Haha
No. Gains are infinite. We will be up to 100 in no time. Buy more, don’t stop buying. Buy and hold. BUY AND HOLD
averaging up to the Moon is the smart play
I bought this morning at $14, feel great about it!
#GoWithWutUknow!
Hahaha crazyyy
"if you're going to trust retardation, you might as well go all the way" - self
You know what? You've convinced me. I didn't drop out of college for nothing.
Added 10 more itm calls today. Keep pumping
should i buy some calls $20 exp jan 2023 ?
Buy some 1DTE $100 strike price calls, this is the way.
haha that wld be supreme retardness
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
I already have 12 shares. What more do you expect? 13?!
One more share, one more share!
Buy as much as you can booiiiiiiiiiii!
Share? What's a share? I only know what options are.
My tits are jacked!!
Fuck it!! Buying more tomorrow!!!

Edit: BOUGHT MORE AT 15 TODAY WE’RE AT 19 RIGHT NOW
This guy fucks
r/thisguythisguys
Harder OP![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
If he’s in I’m in
Buying some every day.
That's how ya Dca, BABEE!😉😃💥💭⬆️⬆️⬆️💫
I will also DCA, I’ll add like 25~ shares when ever it dips through out the months, till I invest like $5k, then I’ll watch it do what it’ll do.
Aim for those dips
Do you feel it?
I can imagine the guy and the watermelon 🥵
You won’t have to imagine much longer
So excited
Outback by the Wendy’s dumpster
Is he going to be a bore and only put one hole in it, or a little kinky and add the second?
the hole will not be drilled beforehand, he is going to have to fuck it open
Melon kunis! Melon kunis! Melon kunis!
What was the price target for the watermelon again? 

Also, was he mod checked?
Bbby pt was 15 for the watermelon
It was 20 to fuck it
He should have reversed it, first fuck it then eat it....
This is absolutely true, I bought in in December of 20 and everyday I opened my app on PM felt like BBBY right now. It seems like an out of control locomotive.
1/2 you are wrong. He was getting lit up in the comments 6 months before the gamma squeeze.  I support everyone to throw 100 bucks at bbby because it will make all the basket theory stocks run too.
Is 74 dollars ok?
🤌🏼
Same lmao
If some random redditor that knew nothing about the stock market wanted to throw 100 at bbby what would be the best way to go about doing that?
You could buy one January 2023 call option and just watch the enormous swings up and down over the coming months. Think of it as dipping your toe into the pool of insanity. Most you could lose is 100 bucks. Your maximum gain is...
Unlimited.
He knows nothing about the stock market and you're telling him to go play with options right away...Like a true degenerate.
Isn’t that how it works though?
First one is free of course
Wait!! If this is his first move on Jan 23 calls then us regards better follow his bets because first one is always free!! Literally can’t go tits up. I’m waiting for TD to finish depositing my Wendy’s check
You get a check, that’s nice, I stuff money in the WIPS machine at 7/11
A meme yesterday preached the easy math that explained option plays to newbies: you could gain 1,000% of your investment, but you can only lose 100%. Simple math. Go get 'em, tiger.
We should probably explain to him the difference between buying and selling an option though, don’t want him writing one by mistake…
That is where Google comes in handy. No need to hold their hand. If they aren't smart enough to do basic research then whatever happens to them is capitalist darwinism at work. If they were to ask, however, then maybe throw them a bone and give them a very basic explanation. But come on, if they aren't willing to do the least amount of research before throwing their money at something that could ruin their lives, not only is a negative result expected and unsurprising, but it proves without a shadow of a doubt that they belong here.
I mean, is this wsb or is this r/stocks? We could tell him about FDs...
Yep. I know literally nothing. Last night I downloaded robinhood. Waiting for my bank account to link before I can add any money. I’m open to any serious suggestions but with 12M people on this sub it’s very difficult to tell what advice is real. 75% seems like trolls. 

I don’t even know why I’m here. Ha. Reddit decided to shove this sub down my throat for some reason and I’ve just been scrolling comments since yesterday.
Big problems with RH. They like to turn off the buy button during squeezes. They can also turn off the sell button if they so desire. The only one to not turn off the buttons was Fidelity. Much, much, MUCH better user support with fidelity too. Pretty much nonexistent with RH.
Thanks for that info. I’ll look into fidelity. Someone also suggested e*trade to me. Again, 100% noob here.
Shame on that person for not telling you that etrade did the same thing as RH.

At the end of the day, you have a brokerage like fidelity or a terribly ran “security certificate” type of company like RH, etrade, and webull. Just to name a few. YOU are the product for these companies. At least with Fidelity, they have their own clearing system. Time proven company and like I said, awesome customer support.
Wallstreetbets is arguably one of, if not the most popular subreddit in the whole website ever since the GME squeeze in January 2021, if you browse r/all or r/popular then you're bound to see posts from this place at least once or twice per day.

So if you don't want to see it, don't browse r/popular or r/all.

>I’m open to any serious suggestions but with 12M people on this sub it’s very difficult to tell what advice is real. 75% seems like trolls.

Nope, altough yeah there are a bunch of trolls and bad actors in here, most of us are just looking to make quick money out of completely fucking stupid stock market plays...It's fun, we all doing it for the shits and giggles.

Best advice I can give you is to ignore all of this and learn how to invest by yourself, and study the companies you want to invest by yourself, don't follow the hype if you don't know what you're doing.
No, January 2023 calls are way more expensive than a 100$ now.
Well played
And where are you seeing January options for $100. The cheapest I see is 585 for a jan $20 strike.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
which j23 strike is worth 100$? The IV crush alone makes it too late for options

lol also the spreads are fucking ridiculous
Make an account with fidelity. Takes a few minutes. Fund account and buy and hold.
If you want to hold the asset(BBBY stock) the best way to hold is in your name through direct registration and not with a broker. If you want to speculate on the price of the asset then 8/19 20C.
I totally took shots at him when he was up a lot at $18. I was wtf you waiting for man? Lol
Except GME and didn’t run today…
It will
oh yes, she shall

Simply got in BBBY just because I didn't know what to buy lol
Sounds like you knew what to buy ;)
I still remember when our goal was $420.69 to squeeze Melvin out of the market for good. It's was pure meme gold.
Let’s not forget citron research

Edit: and the live stream “5 reasons Gamestop will go back to $20.” In all fairness, it did almost go back to $20…after the split ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Yeah, and stopped the livestream cos it aint going down, just told "technical reasons" lol what a spineless regard
And even then it barely scraped under 20
It did make its way back down to $40… and then shot back up to $300 in less than a month.

I remember buying back in under $50 and my friends joked saying I “couldn’t stay away…” got a proper “congrats and fuck you” after that lol
That's still my price target HODL
100 easily
confirmation bias confirmed
This bbby does not have the same manufactured flavor as amtd and the other one. I’m in.

I bought 3ks worth.. at 15.50… soooo ima regret this aren’t I?
I’m right there with you at a similar price number and got 1k shares planning on buying more tomorrow. Let’s do it!
You’ll be a true degenerate in no time!
Regret it now?
I’m loving it rn aha
I don't think people really realize how insane of a play/opportunity this really is, especially with GME having pathed the way.
BBBY is paving the way for the real gme move. This is just the beginning
I’ve got three BBBY calls two bbby shares and few hundred GME shares. LFG 🚀🔥
This is the way \^
GET IT SPANKY ! TENDIES AND NANNAS
dd?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Its like when Steve Rogers broke the 4 minute mile for the first time ever. No one thought that was possible (GME). But the next time it was broken was 30 days later by Tony Stark (BBBY). Things will always be better that is the cycle of regard watermelon life.
"On your left"
  
 \- BBBY, probably
If this becomes the new norm, the markets will collapse. 

Not complaining. Just stating.
If they collapse from this then they shouldn’t have existed at all.
[deleted]
Not if you get out before the crash you homo-noid.
money won’t mean shit if the financial markets collapse
People say this all the time and I disagree. If markets took a 80% dive tomorrow, life will still go on.
It could actually instigate some positive changes in our society
That is why I am trading it all in for nukacola caps
And you think that's a bad thing?  Don't get me wrong, that would probably cause decades of severe hardship for everyone on the planet.  But in the end our children and grandchildren will probably be the first generations to live in a good, just world after the necessary changes that would come from (at the very least) a total revamp of our corrupt, destructive and exploitative society.
Ha. I have no reason to believe the next time around will be better
Be optimistic bro.  It'd be our best chance since the enlightenment to strive for something better
Turn on the news. Not having money isn’t going to stop dumb people making dumb choices. 

This entire sub is proof that dumb choices will be made no matter how much money people have.
It’s not optimism, it’s human nature. “Human nature is surprisingly universal and it is universally disappointing.”
Money doesn't mean shit because the market is full of money that doesn't exist.
Buy assets then.
Maybe not
Not if you Directly Register the company shares in your own name.
Not gonna lie, you might be right. But at least admit that neither of us know.
That’s the whole point. We are exposing a fraudulent market
If it dies, it dies.
I think the 2020's will be remembered as "The Greatest Depression"
Dicks out for Tony Stark!
Options = unlimited profit
Buy one leap and you'll be retired by christmas
Underrated comparison.

It's been more than 30 days since GME
No shit Sherlock ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
😊
Roger Bannister had the first 4 minute mile
Rodger Bannister, regard.
Didn't Roger Bannister run the first ever 4 minute mile?
It seems too easy this time around. But still early days.
How much did the hedge funds learn from GME that may be used to thwart this run?
Melvin capitol learned about -45%
More like negative 100%+

They no longer exist

Their AUM went from idk like $20Billion to literally $0. Less than like 30% of WSB users themselves (the other 70% of us are massively below $0 cuz Yolo loans and shit)
It warms my soul to know that whenever I do have a loss, I know that I was not as retarded as some billionaires in their losses who have probably been trading stocks longer than I have been walking this earth.
Seems like citadel learned an expensive lesson too according to the 13f
Whats it say? I see a few posts on SuperS foaming at the mouth in joy over it.
Down $95B.
percentage?
20%
Damn lol it didn't kill them but it hurt.

And I doubt they actually disclosed everything
Also went from 19 clients to 16.
Down $95B, so far...
They learned some tricks but so did we. It's an arms race. Now it's another battlefield. Godspeed soldier.
Expect sharp drops only to be followed up by more large run-ups.
I have limit orders at $10. One can only hope.
I had a limit order at a little under 13 this morning. I knew it'd drop, but I overestimated by how much.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
[deleted]
That's probably just the market makers being more cautious. GME squeeze in large part was very much due to MM hedging themselves when they sold call options to retail. So now, they are demanding much higher premiums, implied volatility today reached 350%, that's pretty remarkable.

And this higher volatility decreases option buying, which makes it hard to squeeze as was done with GME.
SEC report indicated that hedging did not account for any significant part of the GME runup. Also, they knew the buy button was getting disabled -- they were safe not properly hedging their short calls because they knew they would tank the price.
It's a numbers and time game. We buy and HODL until their house of cards falls down. day by day, week by week, even month by month if needed, we outlast them
My 10.5 9/2 only had 100 or less extrinsic value all day.  I need to get I to think or swim and see the data.

So at about 16.somthing a 17c for 9/22 was 300-400.   So why would someone buy an ATM call with no intrisict value instead of a couple hundred more to get a deep itm?
IV price is determined by the market not MM.  I remember there were times GME had IV of 600%.
6000%
#NoWayOfBeingAbleKeepUpRegardless!
Is BBBY’s short float even close to what GME’s was?   No.  So why is everyone comparing the two?
is there any other higher short interest in the market?
Idk but that’s not relevant
I’ll give a hint, the answer isn’t yes. 

And short interest has grown every day, we’re just getting started
BBBY SI is roughly around 40%, GMe was 140% when it first squeezed so I wouldn't expect anything as epic as that squeeze again.

But somewhere around 90 - 100 is feasible.
if bbby goes to 50 that's more then enough money made for everyone holding right now
Including RC.

50 would put me around 2k, which for me is frankly quite a lot since I don't have much money available to play with stocks.
RC has call options at $60 and $80
ghey bears still being ghey ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
He knows
Both were not just overshorted but clearly undervalued. BBBY owns a franchise called Buy Buy Baby which is valued at $1.5B. The market cap was down at 430M or so and is still only $1.28B. Even when it reaches fair value their will be a ton of shorts in the red who will need to close.

Think of the stock like a ball held under the water. The deeper you pull it down the further it shoots out of the water.
Whose to say they didn’t learn to flip long & take advantage of an army of apes?
If they join us, then they are apes
greed says, at least one could go down over the bbby play
Oh really haven’t heard this before for hundreds of other stocks after gme lol
GME pre-Split: ~76,000,000 shares outstanding 
BBBY now: ~80,000,000 shares outstanding
okay since you realized how insane the play is, please provide your theory why this is happening with data and sources to that data.
He probably won't, likely just in the echo chamber that is this subreddit lol.
GME had over 100% short interest.BBBY has like 40% lol
Can you cliff note why it’s such a good play and supposed to squeeze? I’m all in on gme with about 2000 shares and been following it religiously.
It's quite sad because so many people are blinded by thinking the GME squeeze never happened that they are going to miss this one.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I just dumped what was left of my -90% DOGECOIN investment and put it into BBBY. Hopefully I can make the money I lost in DOGE back.
That’ll be a nice counter to the capital gains taxes from BBBY 😎
BACK DOOR Roth to the rescue
No capital gains taxes in Puerto Rico. Act 60
You guys need to come to the UK and get ISAs
Imagine rebelling over tea tax only to find yourself paying hundreds $k in taxes on capital gains when you could have had tax free ISAs for life and spread bets where tendies are tax free due to it being classified as gambling. Lol a truly highly regarded nation the US is.
Thank you for your service. I look forward to watching my dogecoin quickly rise in value.
If your anything like me, doge will moon days after you sell while trying to chase that squeeze bag :,(((
My doge was up 50% a few days after I bought it. Unfortunately I only threw the $20 free cash I had in my brokerage account at it.

My shib that I put 3k into is down 50-60%. Bitchin' 😎
definitely there is trend for money to flow into crypto memes after stock memes pump
I feel like I’m late to the game but everyone here seems to have pretty high conviction…
Famous last words.
Bout to liquidate my eth which is up to go all in BaBBY
fuck yeah anus ! let it ride to the MOON !!!
Bro holy shit same
I guess misery loves company. Here to making our money back lol
doge went up 15% today. just an fyi.
Ryan Cohen's average cost per share for his 7,780,000 shares is $15.34.

Doesn't factor his $60, $75, and $80 call options.
And his average cost basis for those options were around $1.50 which is where they currently sit
what happens when he exercise? MM forced to by at targeted price?
No he is forced to buy at those prices. I almost guarantee he sold the calls already and is going to slowly dump the rest of his shares. He watched Musk do it with Twtr and wanted to try big boy game.
https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/b08a4b0d-b9fd-467e-a69e-0e96c990ff45

Cohen still holding his original bbby calls
Does he have to exercise those options?  Because the intrinsic value alone would be pure profit if this shit goes to 30+ quick enough.
They would still be OTM
You can sell options even if they are not ITM.
Then they would still only have time value, not intrinsic if they are otm
Thank you, I thought I was a true re-re when I saw the original comment and all the upvotes about OTM options having value
The fact idiots upvoted your statement says a lot.

"Because the intrinsic value alone would be pure profit"

The intrinsic value in your scenario is $0

I need to start selling options, no one here knows how they work at all.
Meant implied volatility, just chose the wrong IV...
Only if someone bids to buy them lol
He doesn't have to do anything because compared to the amount of money he spent on shares they are pocket change. He cannot openly talk about where to enter and exit but he knows we're going to see that SEC filling. It's just a legal way of saying, "This is where I'm going, feel free to jump on board." Plus the gamma pressure helps the squeeze.
Papa going to exercise and it’s going to get litty 🔥
Bbby to the moon, GME to Uranus 🚀
I like this.
[removed]
Exactly this.
GME isn't over, it just paved the way for BBBY
and then bbby can pave the way for gme
GME is far from done, soon apes will have DRS’ed 300% of the float and DTCC and SEC will still pretend everything is ok.

I think we will see absolutely wild things happening, tits jacked and all
GME is like 4000% up in around 2 years since the covid bottom. Still, not done though as you say
But the squeeze never squoze. I'm still waiting for the day of the squozening
That's why we still hold both.
Baghold yes
Are you old enough to be posting here? Get off my lawn.
Keep in mind that when GME mooned!!! Wallstreetbets wasn't even HALF the size that it is now. 

think about that
Good fucking point. Apes stronger than ever.
Apes stronger together.
Apes hodling forever.
When the GME hype started we had less than 1/10th the users
but it was a movement outside of this sub and reddit, but a lot of ppl were burned too, so idk if it will get even remotely as close as the GME hype. but if it does than the train is still at the station
Not trying to FUD either. But also, it was gamestop. Do you know how much retards loved gaming, felt nostalgia, hated how shorters tried to kill their childhood essentially? People genuinely wanted gamestop to bounce back and it was a perfect David VS Goliath with DFV holding the torch. 

BBBY has a different sentiment. Albeit, people still have a sense of comraderie in wanting to get rich and memes. RC is holding the torch here and this may very well be a different day, same old squeeze.
This ain't no movement you fuckin mouthbreather. Trading is not a team support.

I believe this is correct.  I missed GME but glad I am aboard the ship now.
Holy moly didn't think Abt that
Exactly. DFV and GME are the reason we're the size we are now. Let's wreck those hedge fucks for good this time.
Just loaded 55 more shards at 15.85. About 1k more  in gun powder for the rest of the week.
Thanks for reminding us that there's a disable buy button.
There will be repercussions if it happens again. Isn’t the last time still under investigation? I do understand they were legally bound to have a certain amount of collateral for the trades, but in terms of market cap, this shouldn’t be as big of an issue.
I don’t think it was related to market cap as much as volatility. The increased collateral call was a result of volatility. If the DTC did not waive these increased collateral calls Robinhood goes under. They only had 1 billion give or take in cash on hand.

The lesson here imo is this easily could happen again as the hood is in even worse shape
Roll BBBY gains into RH puts.
It's shocking to me how many people are still using RH after that fiasco.
How is Robinhood in worse shape now? They have 6 billion+ in cash according to their earnings report. Additionally, they also have around 3 billion as LoC.
Don’t hold your breath.
You’re joking, right?
[removed]
You have to turn in enough of the tops off the crayon boxes, and they will send you a secret decoder ring that will give you instructions on how to activate it.
Not only that, but at the time WAY more of retail was still in Robinhood. Not that other brokers didn't Disable too, but many of the others just turned off Options and other Ancillary things rather than the Buy Button completely like RH did.

In this way, I actually feel like we might get better price discovery than we did at that time.
Can’t disable option execute ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Yeah the 120+ million volume day today caught my attention.  Buying more this week at payday.
GOD DAMN IT if it goes just $100 

I will literally tattoo bbby and WSB on my fking CHEST!!!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Crazy thing is the price target of $100 is still less than $10bil market cap. If it squeezes like GME we’re looking at $300 a share.
hah you said it so now you must do! Lets get BBBY to $100!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mods??
I’m here for these types of things. I too am a fan of wild tattoo dares and will also get BBBY and WSB somewhere. 

I once had Jim Breuer sign my arm after his show cause my Mom said it’d be funny if I got it tattooed, so I did. Then she said she couldn’t believe I did it.
I need a new tattoo.  And gains like $100 would bring could pay for an elaborate one.
The $2k I invested…Ahhh I could take it or leave it
I can't wait to see the DRS numbers for GME next month. I want to see how many real shares have been taken out of the DTC. BBBY's volume has been trading the entire float almost every day but all of the brokers are more than likely dealing with IOUs. I still feel that GME is the only true squeeze. BBBY is just the appetizer.
There’s going to be so many apes throwing their bbby gains into GME. They truly are fucked…they are about to find out 😏
That's what I plan on doing. Rolling the earnings right into Computershare.
Are you me? Just hope the BBBY ride keeps on going. I haven’t seen this much noise since GME so I’m hopeful it will continue. With RC buying how far OTM calls, it makes one wonder. 🍻
I'm holding BBBY until the end of January 2023 at least. I want to see what happens at the end of this month with Buy Buy Baby and I want to see how long the current market participants can trade the float of BBBY every single day.
Since the squeezening, started with BB, AMC, then GME, now BBBY. All options profits went to increase GME share position for long term holding. GME position now  XXXX.
ooooh, this is what I want to hear!  so glad i am here.
you realize that you can play both right? or are you guys so fucking brainwashed that you think that losing out on money is a good thing?
Who's to say I'm not in both. I can polish this smooth brain for us if you promise to lick my leather cheerio.
All very exciting, then you guys are coming back for me and my $WISH bags? Guys, guys…
Sorry bro. Take the loss and get in bbby
Bueller? Anybody? Hellloooooooooo?
Thanks for sharing! I missed out on GME but ain’t no fucking way I’m missing out on BBBY. TO URANUS!
Gains from GME 2.0 into GME 3.0
Is this web3?
Sir, this is a Wendy’s bathroom
BBBY TO MYANUS
GME is just getting started
Idk how you can say this with a straight face…..I made a good bit on gme last year but at some point I think ya gotta admit that it already started and had a run. Past performance doesn’t indicate future success
Literally.. the time to make money in GME is over.. BBBY is the next train and people still clinging to AMC and GME are straight up going to miss it.
Idk why we downvoted but I think hoping gme hits $300 again is a pipe dream. I bought at $80 and sold in the $200s was happy lol
I think the downvotes are because GME is more than a squeeze to the new investors. They see the potential for profit in the GameStop Wallet and the NFT marketplace. Sure there are some bag holders from the run up in 2021, but the DRS movement is going long.
This ain't no movement you fuckin mouthbreather. Trading is not a team support.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
I would think even the early bag holders would have had time now to have averaged down and be even if not green now
Lmao
Whats your position
Doggy style. 

780 shares

19 calls at 12c exp. 8/19

29 calls at 20c exp. 8/19

66 calls at 45c exp. 8/19

80 calls at 25c exp. 9/16

Aka: full retard
Yeah insane position but hey gamble away winner!
How much did all of this cost you? Godspeed.
Yes.
Bro you ain’t late for nothing. The splividend was so everyone could afford at least one moon ticket.
Bravo my dear sir, exactly my thoughts. Everyone stop trying to put a price target or date on where we are gonna fly to just strap in, get some excitement and enter/exit where you feel happy with. Low float, low market cap, 10M apes, alot of hype, minor fed meetings until mid September. Let's go!!
Why would you exit when you feel happy? 

Just don’t, ever, exit.
? Fed meeting minutes come out this Wednesday
I have other option positions I'm trying to get profits on. Those profits will go to more BBBY when I can get out of the trades. At least $4k worth. I think the opportunity here is ridiculous considering AMTD, and GME (despite RH and Melvin Capital's bullshit)

I doubt RH would dare try to block the purchasing again considering their pending litigation.

Let's make some cash off those motherfuckers
While one can appreciate your enthusiasm, never think that these fucks won't do shit they have been doing for decades.

Edit: incorrect spelling.
True, true. If they do pull off some stupid loophole, I won't be miffed if I lose everything I put in. So I'll play my own part regardless of the outcome.

Besides, I've been thinking too hard. It's nice to be stupid for a change and allow my head to be empty while I throw money at Buy Buy Baby.
And they’ve had a year and a half to figure methods to suppress retail buying.
They'll try, they'll always fail. Strength in numbers works, always has. APEs together strong
Wtf do AMTD and GME have to do with BBBY?
They are connected through swaps
Proof?
AMTD has no relevance to these other two securities
Based on my backwards calculations, GME Market cap was $1.2B when share price was $16. Rn BBBY is at $1.2B Market cap.

Pre-Split GME had about 76million shares outstanding. Today BBBY has almost 80million shares outstanding.
Elaborate pls. What does this imply to you? I'm still a young ape
It means apes together strong buy buy buy now
Bagholder spotted.

It means literally nothing
Dude I feel this post so hard. I’m the guy who browsed Reddit from the popular feed. Then one day mid January 2021 WSB sub made front page. The title was something along the lines of “hold retards hold!!!!” Lol.

And that’s how I became a holder of GME. Bought at $32 and $256 and everything in between since. 

My ONLY regret was not discovering it early January or maybe late December. Other than that, no regrets.

Edit. Holding BBBY
If BBBY hits 420 I'll wear a bear suit and walk into Walmart carrying a watermelon
So BBBY to $5000?
When lambo?
What makes everyone think that the hedge funds will act exactly the same way they did during GME squeeze? I doubt, now that they are monitoring this site, that they will make the same mistake again and just continually double down until they are forced to close and send it rocketing. 

It’s just hard to imagine that they wouldn’t change anything after GME. Yet all I hear on here are people acting like they should expect the exact same action? 

Why?? This is a serious question.
This is THE question. It's been too easy so far. At some point tutes may dump and move the price way down. Or perhaps there's a faction of MMs who are also playing for a squeeze? I don't trust that this will play out like GameStop.
Honestly I don't think it will. I think its more likely that we are being set up for a potential short squeeze that might not ever happen. Like you guys said, if it's too good to be true it probably is. I can't see them setting us up to liquidate them all over again. Who knows... there is still alot of shorts getting burned, and a whole lot of fomo going on, so it's worth a couple trades.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

They learned all and nothing at the same time. Greed is whats killing 90% of all gains. On this board and in the boardrooms of companies. Also, according to the investigation the GME runup was because of buy pressure from retail and other traders, not because someone covered.
That’s not exactly true..we don’t know that to a certainty. They said that retail pulling in was the catalyst for the move but not the cause of all of it. The wording in that report seemed to avoid mentioning margin calls or whatever but moves like that only happen in short squeezes. GME wasn’t the first…there have been a few over the years and they tend to look the same. BBBY has been a steady up of 10-30% each session instead of the all at once GME push that was obviously a short squeeze.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
if anything hedgies are riding bbby as it goes up
That’s exactly what I think. They are playing the retail side. If you can’t beat ‘em. Join me. That would explain this price action logically. That institutions are pumping it as well. Hoping to cash out and leave some retail traders of course holding the bag. This would be the smartest move and I don’t see hedge funds as dumb by any means…well maybe citadel. But other than that.
also i think it’s all eyes on wall street bets since GME incidence as they need to keep a watch on what the next retail fomo is going to be ie BBBY... but don’t worry , institutions need to make the money and dump onto retail! so definitely they ride BBBY up and dump it on retail
so yeah they’ll ride it up and probably short it down to oblivion
how about u eat my ASS

Sounds like a good way to make a few million.
infinite money glitch unlocked!

yeah bbby and gme is the money printer of the moment!!
They have no choice.  They are painted in a corner and have no way out.  They are desperate and doing anything they can for... one more day.
Well you sold it to me🤣
You’re missing the part where 8/10 subs are just apes lurking trying to catch the next GME, joined strictly b/c they wanted to catch the next GME, and are probably already holding heavy BBBY bags.

The conditions of this new scenario as it pertains to WSB specifically are wayy different than the start of the GME scenario. People were clowning on DFV at the start. For months. They were not buying in en masse.

If there is a critical mass point at all to the BBBY thing, it isn’t nearly as far away as GME was when GME began gaining momentum on this sub or the critical mass point has already passed.
Is me with 6300 shares ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
This guy fucks ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I've had three day trades in the past week, all flinching on BBBY. I went as yolo as I could and I'm doing it again tomorrow morning. Fuckin hodl
An 11 yo account talking yolo. My tits are getting re-jacked
You jacked my tits
And you tits my jacked.
You have my tits jacked, BBBY to the moon 🚀
2500 shares avg price 10 bucks
enough with the GME vs BBBY... if one begins the other will trigger. Profit taking flows between all of them and it happens like clockwork.
Basket stocks rotating like the Earth around the Sun.
But they've mastered the dark pool buy pressure blockade and see what reddit is posting just like we can.  You think they'll get burned by the same trick again?
If there is one thing that I have learned is that its always difficult to add when a stock is going up but we don’t think twice when the stock is going down. Truth is it should be exactly the opposite in most cases. Go with the momentum and ride the train up.
Are you sure you’re in the right place? We always fomo in when it’s going up and are too depressed to buy when it’s going down. Then finally we paperhands and sell the bottom.
Buy high sell low 🧠
I'm a 1980 GenZ talking to older GenZ and younger Millenials... What are WE doing to help the cause? Looking at charts? That doesn't help. Asking for "guarantees" from a YOLO? That doesn't help? IT'S CALLED A MEME STOCK.. MEME, Are you hitting the SHARE button on all your social media sites? sharing the MEME's that have been created? That is what would help. Spread the MEME's.... spread the love, not the panic. Rant over.
That's one of the reasons, at least towards the end, that GME blew up so much. People buying billboards in NYC and shit like that, it got so much publicity compared to BBBY.
Indeed. However, we as company "owners" now must promote. We seen what publicity will do. Even bad publicity is good publicity. We have to be the billboards now. And share the sh!t OUT OF it.And if ppl delete us because of it, they weren't friends to begin with and one less person coming to ask for money when bbby goes completely off the grid...
Tik Tok would probably be the smartest place to promote.

LFG○○○○○○○○○○○
1980 is GenX my guy
Absolutely 100% it is...lmao... I'll take, what is I need to proof read for a thousand Alex?
True, true. If they do pull off some stupid loophole, I won't be miffed if I lose everything I put in. So I'll play my own part regardless of the outcome.

Besides, I've been thinking too hard. It's nice to be stupid for a change and allow my head to be empty while I throw money at Buy Buy Baby

Edit: spelling
I’m getting ready to load up on more, waiting for money to transfer and I’ll probably get in hopefully still in the teens range by tomorrow
The option market makers will have to buy more stock to hedge as the price rises … this is so juicy

QRTEB!!! 88% insiders ownership!!!!
 can someone point me to the bobby DD?
I’m ready to reach heights never before seen to mankind
I’m in bbby yolo 💎💎💎
Most people think bbby will be like gme or amc. I think  we’ll see 1000+ . I’m holding 6k shares and will add this week again.
How will bbby get to $1000 a share?
Grabbed a small bag of 100 shares today at $15.58, LFG!
And GME didn’t even squeeze. That was pure buy pressure. There really is no limit to this.
Gme would have went to $1k if retail traders had a real broker instead of RH. A holes.

My buy buttom was not disabled.
Why is anyone still using RH?  Are they on MySpace too?
I agree with this but it just seems like GameSpot had a better opportunity.  They were selling games and needed to change to online strategies. Bed bath and beyond is just a dumpsterfire. Even with more strategies focused around e-commerce and a spin off or buy of baby brand, it won't have an impact like gamestop had the potential of having. 

I'm here because of the squeeze that is inevitable, and Ryan Cohen. I'm just hoping I spot a good time to get out later on before I'm left holding a sack🤣
Agreed, I am just hoping to have some semblance of a portfolio
I consider myself more of a pessimist with the moon stocks. But I truly believe the removal of the buy button for GME is the only thing that stopped it from hitting $700 (minimum). The day before the last removal I was getting so many messages from friends and family mentioning they finally bought GME. The media frenzy mixed with people longing for something to do during COVID would have squeezed that stock so far.
So what your saying is, if I have a few k to yolo, don’t wait for a pull back? 🤔🤔
Gather round the campfire apes. I followed the DFV. Bought in at \~$12, sold half at $18 in December. I thought I was so smart hedging my position. Sold covered calls on some at $20. A squeeze would not happen in my lifetime.

And because of these choices, I missed being a millionaire. Don't be like me. believe in the squeeze
I learned options with GME (first ever leaps was gme at $13 lol and I hit 10,000%) but didn't learn about covered calls until later. So lucky bc I would have been right there with ya.

I'm not sure what to do with bbby. I want to play for nostalgia but now I mostly chill with theta gang so not even sure if I'm psychologically capable of a home run anymore...
The short interest on this is irresponsibly high, just over 47% of total shares. Hold this mofo and it can really take off.

Expect a sell attack, which may make you want to cut your losses. Do so at your own peril. Shorties are likely to try to dump their shares to shake out the weak hands. That's the time to start buying low. Keep it from getting too low so they can't exercise them. BOOM.
Now all we need is some TikTok zoomers to mass post BBBY $1000 DO NOT SELL
It’ll work too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Sold 50 shares at $20, bought back in 400 shares at $24.90. Am I doing it right?

Ps is this why my wife won’t touch me?
DFV was in for well over a year before the sneeze, and it was never down to one dollar.
That’s why I’m still holding not going to let go until it’s at least at 50
420 here
You gonna be real sad when it goes $419, $420.01, then blam 696.96![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA FUNNY SEX NUMBER WOW HAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAA
Here's a strategy for weak hearted on these insane plays.

Use fibonacci. If you bought at 7 for example, skip next fib and wait until price gets to 13. At 13 add enough so you CB is around 8.

Rinse and repeat. When your CB is around 8, skip 13, wait until price gets to 21, add until your CB gets to 13.
CB?
Cost basis

Edit: * cock bong
Thank you

This my fellow ape is really smart, thank you!
You're welcome
THE MASTER PLAN OF  RYAN COHEN RC VENTURES : Rise the cap market of BBBY to be equal to GameStop and then merge BBBY with GME to form a new bigger company called GMERICA: Warehouse of BBBY will be used as fulfillment centers, Stores of BBBY will be used as distribution centers and GameStop market place will be used as method of payment by Blockchain for all transactions to compete with Amazon. We are witnessing the formation of the Biggest Corporation in the World (Merger between 
$BBBY
 and 
$GME
 : Most of the executives at GME joined from Amazon. THIS IS HUGE 
- You guys remember on July 7th CFO Mike Recupero was said not fit at GameStop? He was released to take the position of CEO at BBBY and that’s legal and not conflicting with the Business Agreement signed of standstill signed between Ryan Cohen and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Your not getting enough credit for this post! I believe gme applied with the ftc to be able to sell a variety of more goods such as bbby in store offerings.  The company thay was mentioned was gmerica.  That is the master plan, and when this is done im fully going all in on gme as I feel that is the news coming at the end of august.
FUCKING A. Take this rocket lumpy!
I bought a whoopin 35 more today, paid the premium 16 bucks a piece for em!! 😃😃😉🤣😂😁😎

I'm up to a hefty ol' 75 Bbby's now! hehe!  Lol!!, better look out, I'm plowin thru😁
Help me understand why this is being so hyped. Gme had 224% reported. It had been boxed down way harder than bbby. Is the position held by an absolute degen like plotkin? Is retail suddenly the only ones learning from this? This is.....fever.
you are asking too many questions. just buy 🦍🦍
^This account was made 26 days ago and this is its only post - this whole thing reeks…
And yet people anyone who disagrees with the apes are the ones they call shills. I love the irony
L
Got it, sell order set for $2000. Thanks.
I bought at over $300 because smooth brain. But, over a year later, I still hodl.

Best turn up that liquidity knob. Seems like they have learned something new from gme so the buttons should work this time around.

$100-$200 is not a meme
I plan to hold as long as possible
High demand in the watermelon market!!
You're right, I'll buy even more.
Fool us once removing buy button.  Can’t use that same truck again.  Removing sell button…![img](emote|t5_2th52|8880)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
And to add from some throwback screenshots shared here, maybe fractional shares could even be worth more. I remember seeing some posted on here that went for $3k+, while whole shares were being traded in the $300s before big brother unplugged the Nintendo

Edit: fractional GME shares
I remember how it felt.
GME was crazy, it was absolutely everywhere and took over the internet, all socials, tv, billboards. It had the heel (Melvin). Every random was hopping in all the way up, it was a true movement that everyone wanted to be a part of in some form. That would be an absolute feat to duplicate that.
This ain't no movement you fuckin mouthbreather. Trading is not a team support.

I may end up buying some tomorrow, so prepare for a dip
I was here too, sold way too early at around 14$ and closed my 4/25 25c calls for a loss. Not doing that mistake again.
Yeah I’ll buy more tomorrow. It makes me chuckle.
Those were good times man 🥲
Dd checks out.
Lots of great points on here. More apes now than GME squeeze, Hedgies playing if you can't beat em join em. BUT this is also just a really good store that sells all sorts of things you didnt know you needed. Tip your stripper with a BBBY gift card. They get it. To the moon!!
Better yet, call Cramer, ask for his opinion and do the opposite
He already said to sell.
Idk what this means, I just like the towels

Watching the upvotes rack up got me just as jacked as reading 💪💪
You fuckers got me.
Selling all my BB shares and buying BBY.
Y’all don’t understand the squeeze hasn’t happened yet! It is all regular buying pressure, covering hasn’t started.
I sold all my other stocks today and ALL IN for my BaBBy.  It's going to hit 420.
Those were the days
I know I might be too late, but loosing money with you regards is exciting af. JUST OPEN the casino already!!! 100+ tickets and buying more 🌝🚀
I just bought more shares!  Let’s goooooo!! 🚀🚀
BUY! BUY! BUY!
Do we have a "DFV" tho?
Fuck it. Buying for the first time. Here we go again.
1) the squeeze never squoze 

2) the theory wasn't rediculous. It was literally working before they naked shorted the stock to oblivion

If you're going to give advice plz don't be retarded
I kept thinking i was late to the gme buying small amounts around the 10-10 range and took a chance at $35 days leading up to the spike. I’m glad i did. Gme took me out of poverty big time
42 shares please let me sell them at 420
Just think about the person who sold half a share for 2500$. 

Half a share. No joke.
Fuck it. I bought another 40 @17. With the last of my disposable income.
BBBY has not even hit its 6 month high yet (seriously)

Edit: ok well things changed, but still hasn’t hit it’s one year high
I bought GME at $65 and still walked away with over six figures profit
Imagine thinking GME has squoze
So confident with BBBY and GME
LOL for thinking gme squeezed already 💀 I’m retarded but I’m definitely not autistic enough to say that it squeezed already.
It definitely squeezed already. Where you been?
Definitely not in this sub yoloing on pump and dumps but y’all do you 💀🦅
So hold up. You think a stock that went from $5 to $472 wasn't a squeeze? Just to be on the same page. Can I ask you a question? Are you high?
This bbby sqz is fake as shit.
the watermelon play isn't faked...
Shilling hard
[removed]
It's obvious to anybody with a brain... the amount of pump here is at best a distraction from GME... at worst it's to try and prove the basket effect false. Wait and see you hedge fuck.
Sucks you spent all your trust fund on puts.  Just ask mommy for some next month.
Hahahhahahahahha!haahahqhqaba
You got any other logical explanation for RC’s position?
Have you considered the simplest explanation: he’s an idiot
This is a nice way of pissing on my lef and telling me it's raining.
I really want to invest, but I legit have a wedding I need to pay for. Good luck apes
If you really expect GME 2.0, you're in for a bad time.
This guy’s bags must be fucking enormous. HOLY COPIUM
Funny, this is the same shit yall told me after the GME squeeze.
Apes also had government stimi checks to use
Nothing like encouraging people to recklessly gamble away their money right before a massive depression
We are all going to make so much money 🚀
Thinking about going big tomorrow..I'm scared though 😬
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
FYI it *usually* dips right when markets open, so don't get overly excited (or distraught) if it starts out fuggly

Also be careful buying in too high pre-market

But.. Volume was like x5 normal so there's def some hype behind this, just don't gamble anything you can't lose
Look at the account you’re replying to. This entire thread is full of them. This whole thing is orchestrated.
GME really killed this place. Now it’s nothing but  grifters manipulating gullible fucks into buying pump and dumps under the guise of “IT’S A MOVEMENT XXXXDDDD, INVEST AS A TEAM!!!! NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE XXDDDD”.     

Any of the accounts with actual people falling for this shit should genuinely get their head checked
PUT YOUR HANDS UP vi33nros3!!! POLICE ARE ENROUTE! PREPARE TO BE BOOKED FOR PROVIDING ILLEGAL FINANCIAL ADVICE!

Weird..whats going on here? Whose behind the shill accounts??
You should be held accountable for this bullshit when BB doesn't even break $20 and dumps hard. Banned from the sub for encouraging naive people.
You seem pretty naive
Selling 500 of my GME shares first thing in the morning for BBBY.

Then going to HODL the remaining 2000 GME shares I own :)
Meantime media throwing garbage at BBBY [12 photos showing the sad state of Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/photos-that-show-bed-bath-beyond-102454218.html)
You are pure bullshit.
this is so fake
Haha
Squeeze Squoze !!
Are there big players shorting bbby like with GME?
MODS WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?   
WE NEED PROOF
Keep in mind that a lot of people bought GME at the top.
Pumpers gonna pump.
Where can I buy bbby options? Relatively new to options. Checked e trade, nothing there
GME squoze so BBBY could squeeze 🙏🙏
Sold around $400 and bought a plaid model S a year later. Got extremely lucky. Lots are still chasing the dream. Not many will make it but that’s how the casino keeps you coming back
Lol wasted your profits on a Tesla
Was worth it.
Jacked to the tits!
This guy gets it.
Uhhh gme to $300??? Am I high or blind???
2020
No brother I'm being 100% serious here when tf did gme hit 300 dollars or even 100? Am I looking up the wrong stock? Is this a meme? Am I braindead??? Tell me!
Gamestop peaked at $400 in January 2021
Yea I vividly remember this, why is it when I look up gme's history on Google it says it only went up to 80 bucks? Does it show you that too?
The stock split was 1 to 4, so if peak show $86, multiple it by 4
Aaahh thats what I was looking for thank you for that.
My pleasure
I agree with this sentiment fully.
Thanks for letting us know that our delusions aren’t even delusional enough yet!!!🚀🚀🚀
Space troopers, aliens to another world
Yes I'm new to this stock thing but haven't had this much fun since I learned that touching my pee pee feels good. Thank yall 💓
if it goes up to 1000$ i'll make an onlyfans and post my trades
To the moon
On schwab I don't see any options over 26 dollars with expiration after the 19th Aug?  Any other firm offering higher strikes?

Maybe is hasn't updated?
Look at January. They go up to $80
Yup.  I also see Nov calls at 35 on Schwab. I am sure more strikes will appear tomorrow.
I hope so.
Well said
That being said what can we do different? Different brokers?
Where is DFV anyways, figured he’d be all over it
Bunch of ppl tried to sue him so he's doing what his army of lawyers said, keeping quiet.
sell at $420.69 or die trying
Buying calls again for $60 for January. If RC is in, I'm in.
Squoze is my favorite word from now on. Something about it feels so good
*Straps on regarded helmet.
Real question: what is stopping them from disabling the buy button on this when it reaches $20? Or even less?

I'm in this with 2k worth of options so I hope it skyrockets but just wondering why they wouldn't just do damage control right away
LETS FUCKING GO!
What’s good with SPY? What’s that about?
$BBBY> $HKD, set sell order at $10,000
AMEN!
Last I checked, Bed Bath can't correct my jacked up teeth out of the back of a bus... we should be looking at SDC instead.
Right now I’d say anything under $30 is still a steal. 
I bought on the 11th, 12th and 15th. I’ll keep adding as long as there is still the potential for gains. 
No idea how high it will go. In for the ride!
#RULE 4 🦍🔫
I think that’s the first time I’ve ever seen/read/heard “squoze”
Ok, maybe 1 more contract of $80 call tomorrow.  You ain't getting more from me, no sir.

Maybe Wednesday.
Let's go BoBBY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
As one who bought gme at $20, I’m fucking in!
The squeeze has not even squoze yet.  Was nothing but a little teeny tiny sneeze
Bed Bath and Beyond retarded is going to be GME 2.0
That auto mod “squeeze these!” reply has definitely been intentionally disabled this week lololol
$30c 11/18. is that retarded of me? is it likely for the stock to double in price in 3 months?
lol
I have 11k sitting in a crypto account that keeps going more down than up. I wanna take a stab at throwing it at BBBY and seeing if I can make some real dough but I’m not sure how to go about it. I’ve read a shit ton of comments on different posts on this sub about shorting and squeezing and what not but I have no idea what any of this means. Anyone who can give me some solid advice I would appreciate it big time.
Bought $3,500 worth so far now up to $4,700.  I shouod double position tomorrow, yes?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Will be buying 5 x 20Jan23 $15 calls tonight. God speed.
Ok, just ordered 10 more at open. Wish I could YOLO with the big tards. Just looking for a little chicken tendie combo meal to get me through the night.
Lol just bactest the bbby chart this isn’t that big of a deal
I can remember when gmd was 10 at first.

Then the price keep going up.

Even when gme was something 20$ i didn't buy it either also.

Then brought instead AMC at 18$.

Next 2 day it went from 18$ to 5$.

Lessoned learned and bought more shaders at 8$.
420.69
The apes have returned.
OP is right.  Power to the sub.  During the GME squeeze I posted at like 1/3 in the run up that I thought it was over and I was wrong.  Won't make same mistake this time, a bit late to the party 'cause I was out surfing but I'll throw down some calls.  LFG
Bought my first BBBY at open after clearing out a bunch of positions that had been flailing for forever. Purely FOMO, no DD.

Now, I see they have an approx. 80 million share float. According to schwab, they're 87% owned by institutions. Volume today was more than double the entire float. 

Oh, its tendie time.
What options y’all buying though?!?!?
$25 is the ticket to the moon. That’ll really pump the gamma squeeze and things will absolutely take off from there.

Regards, Regards.
I’m in!!

3000 shares

25 $8.5 calls 8/19

50 $50 calls 1/20
Sigh feels like a scam. No where to put in FFL
Gme has never left the chat tho
Bought 5650 sh of BBBY Monday afternoon...
If we’re using when rc took 10% of gme we are at when gme was $4
Yes of course, I was there too. I suppose most of us were, but would it be too much to ask for a TLDR?  Calls or puts?
No
GME hasnt truly squoze, it's going to squozen my dude
Yeah suckers. Buy now and hold my bag! 
-op
Hell yeah I’m fired up
Don't forget the the options market on GME was absolutely fucking nuts
And GME don't even sell pillows.
do you know any place I could short like 50 shares and buy a call so that the leverage is not that hard? or just combine options? Say I am willing to buy at this price in a year if it did not squeeze after that? ok. Now if the price rises and I exercise the call and sell half of the shares I still make money while contributing to the squz right?
fuck these theta shorts im doin it
true story
Long time autist, first time retard here - I’m in for 1,000 shares. I’m so excited for these ‘tendies’ I’ve heard so much about
For all you still in the sidelines, this is the dip you where looking on BBBY. 
And always remember; “The Trend is your Friend!”
I'm just getting started tbh, buy buy buy boys.
Bagholder spotted.

50 shares bought this morning 🤌 lambo soon
Train is leaving guys, jump in !
To. The. Moon.
I like ridiculous
1 question regarding BBBY - Lot of Fomo is because of RC calls in Jan. My question is even if the stock goes upto $100 even then he cannot exercise his calls currently. Is my understanding correct?
I’m ready to reach heights never before seen to mankind
did gme go to 300 because of a squeeze, or because people kept buying it?
What's the free float shares compared to GME?
Watch BBBY go to 2000$ now.

🥰🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is hype 🙏🔋
Put in my next buy… not too late!!
GME had a better future tho
Why the fuck are we still talking about this shit
ok i´m in
“Could have”?

RobinHood themselves, other brokers and SHFs said that it absolutely would have, as part of justifying turning off the buy button.

It still will ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
The POWER of everyone just buying ONE share.

We ARE the BIGGEST  funds.
BBBY fooks hard.
BELIEVE THE SQUEEZE
Can someone educate me on this.  I feel kind of dumb for asking but how does this work.  Does Reddit just find a meme stock then pump and dump?  I’m totally cool with it I just want to know what to look out for.  I’m pretty sure I missed the boat on this one
I have a kidney infection.
I'm buying more with the dip today 🤞
I remember the “goal” was $80-100…..then it went to fucking $400+. The feeling of euphoria was fucking insane.
👍
The amount of short sellers in BBBY is way too high. They are getting squeezed very badly.
Just bought 70 shares this morning at 15.65. I hope you are correct.  I'd love to see 200 a share.
Ive been playing with options on a mock trading app and wanna buy some real calls at 18 and 19$ that expire in a months time, full retard or go back to practice?
Buy everyday, get paid paid paid
Halted lmao
I bought at $12. No problem at all
this is not the advice you are looking for
Just bought 100 more stock at 24 to add to my 40 I got at 10.38
Interesting consolidation on BBBY right now, this will move soon.  25.25 seems to be a pivot point
Just put cash into APRN as well

DVN will squeeze next 🚀🤑
@ what price does beautiful Melon Kunis get raped on tape?
Guess who sold $1000 of GME at $19
This retard
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh

🤙🏼
BBBY is just a pump by wsb. some of you will get out rich some will hold the bags. This is a WSB unintentional Ponzi it won't be the hedge funds that lose out this time.
Bed, Bath, and Beyond is a shit company. 

BBBY has short term potential to make you money. 

Important distinction.
How much can I make with the 5 calls I have? It’s up 300% but should I wait till it goes itm?
Don’t forget all other meme stocks are doing well too we have the AMC thing. It’s looking really bad for the short all over the place
Ok, I'd say $20 tops, and if it breaks it (which I doubt), then $45, but that's it.
I’ll fuck a watermelon with a pepperoni stick up my ass, the spicy kind , if bbby hits 100$ 🍉🍕🌶
Shut up BBBY isn't going to be GME stop fucking ruining people's life
I went all in at NKLA. SHORT squeeze  coming with Toyota buy out.
Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Yes yes yes..I want those nuts
Fucktards GME Loses money and pays a dividend. What the Fuck!
This is the exact reason why I know I'll be late to sell. This is my first time entering a squeeze play,  and I haven't the foggiest idea what kind of profits I should hold for. I've thought for the last 2 days "there's not a fucking shot it keeps going up." and then it does.

Equal parts scary and enthralling, and we very well may be just starting to ramp up in terms of price action.
Gme dejavu
Being a part of something like that would be pretty great. Time will tell.
We were all here you fucking retard. All the new posters are bots.
I want YOU to remember something. GME is now at 40 bucks a share with a 12 BILLION MARKET CAP. 999 .9 million TIMES TWELVE. If you want GME at 80 bucks a share you should find another 12 billion.

Same applies to BBBY. Give some good advice. Watch the volume and market cap, and for God Sake don't but when it's overvalued. It's quite literally just not worth it!
And where is DFV now? Oh right, not in bbby
I've already lost all my gme gains trying to find the next gme.
It depends on if people gonna go all in after you do. You see, it's kind of like a ponzi scheme. Last in gonna lose and last outs. If you go for it you gotta be like all the apes in the comments trying to scheme others for your own profits sake. If you can trick other people you know into doing it after you it's great for your profit. +Profit -Firends. Hard to be ape I guess and there is no return for them that persuade a life in the harsh reality of jungles.
There were also months of posts after the peak, about how the squeeze hadn't happened yet..

Plenty of people expected $300+ as well, shit I'm not sure any pumper predicted lower than that. It wasn't getting pumped endlessly for a paltry 10x gain.
It's the squeeze people it means 5% take profit and 95% bag hold
No more 
Buy stocks you believe will hold good fundamentals
Even if they face headwinds it's to be expected
But if you buy off your research and conviction you will be triumphant

Their loss though, the amount of float BBBY has 200 isn’t out of the question
I'm still kicking myself for selling a 16c 8/19 yesterday. Won't make that mistake this time.
I did, and took it off. Holding for more.

What app is that?
80? That’s barely the ATH you dick
BUY THE DIP
Holding till $1000+
What is the goal? 80$?
I’m all for you guys doing it.

But let’s be real for a second, there can be change, and it can become a great company.

If you all hold, and encourage management from Buy Buy Baby to migrate over and increase worker retention at the store level going into a recession, you may be regarded enough to allow them to survive.

If they survive and the management from the more successful counterpart can find success, going into better economic times in the late 20’s, they will be well positioned for sales growth. 

Middle management is extremely important in retail. Having clean, well run stores, people to ensure adherence to standard and practices, and taking care of the team as a whole…

Or there is the option to sell buy buy baby… and oh baby is that lucrative as well. 

Not financial advice, I do not own BBBY  because I’m too damm smart for my own good and think team cash is better… which is fucking stupid considering you guys eat crayons and are much more wealthy than I because of it.

Hodl to infinity and bed, bath and **beyond**!
it‘s halteeeeed boooooooiis
This morning I said fuck it and transferred some money to my broker and bought in at 16. So far I'm very happy.
Mind if I cash out at the top and you hold my bag on the way down?
I missed out on the great GME wars, but I was just in time to get in on this one. I don’t make enough to buy big, but I got some shares and they are staying where they are until much further notice.
TIGR next 🚀🚀🚀🚀
just recently worked at one, def the biggest issues were having supply and workers. (had to quit because moving) now if only the ports in California would speed up because that has caused so many issues. anyways, sure i'll hop on

Buys a stock... is called a manipulator
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Buys nft of Morgan Freeman meme. Loses.
That’s tough.
Jails aren’t big enough for all of us. Ironically just one large jail could hold all of the billionaires!
[There actually is one that is, its called Australia. It was the biggest jail on earth. They'll lock us all up with the Kangarooos me boy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayfCmvmQiV4)
Dont threaten me with actual healthcare
How are normal people manipulating the stock market? Buying a stock you like is not manipulation.
What are you, a retail investor??
We're halted boys and girls.
[removed]
I like the stock. 🤷‍♂️
Not positive that playing dumb would be enough to throw out all the solid evidence in half these posts...   people being criminally stupid without realizing it or somethin.    Lots of posts talking about BBBY where the play is strongly implied as a pure attempt at market manipulation by talking about how many people 'we' could get to buy.  It's wild.
i'm dead serious here. how is buying a stock manipulating the market?   
this are all trades based on publicly available information. if buying a highly shorted stock is manipulation and threat to the market then how is excessive shorting allowed in the first place and not labeled as manipulation?
buying a stock is NOT market manipulation.  telling everyone else they need to buy/hold for the 'plan' to work and actively trying to coordinate buying together and pumping a stock would be the manipulation part.   obviously.
Crodsourcing an attempt to constrain supply.
The stock went from $20 to around $9 in 4 weeks, then went to $5 a couple weeks later - you see it's okay when they're manipulating the price down, nothing to see here.
We don’t manipulate the market 😑
All the hit piece articles and joke analysts downgrading or saying it’s dismal ‘look at my pics hurdurr’

Fuck them all

We HOLD
OP this is good, I a gonna share the conspiracy sub? I'll award you too
they are just making it worse by halting.. keep fights boys.
i wish we had the power to manipulate a stock like they do
The market cap is still super low 1/10th of gme
FUCKIMG crooks
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
TIGR next 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I didn’t manipulate a god damned thing. I saw deep value in a couple companies and invested.
This should be set in stone
I dont think any shorters call this manipulation 😂 wtf, do they?
Should be top story of reddit.
Bro I love this meme but at the same time we ain't manipulating shit!!! We just knew something early enough to see it developed and hopped on the train that is the battle of the rich vs the other rich. We just hopping along for the ride my man!

I'm conflicted between "photos taken moments before disaster" and "username checks out."

Best of luck.
that damn FOMO, hope it's wasn't too late to get in on this, should I put a stop loss around 15.50?   limit sell at 16.50?   thoughts?
Diamond hands BBBoY
Go to the moon. $50 or bust.
That’s like barely cruising altitude
Was expecting a correction day but shit just took off again. $20 eod 🚀
Already there
Remember Apes, there’s a big seller at $15.95 on ARCA. After it buys over the sells at $16 it’s take off time.
U are why I am 💎🙌
is this thing gonna hit $20?
Damn straight. Look at the volume BBBY
Damn calls against em too soon, how come I can’t post screen shots in the thread
I bet you have the biggest boner right now fuuuuuuck
This is the way
Hope you sold this weeks 20c contracts against those… you’d get 25k in premium 🤣🤣
I wish I did a few min ago, hopefully it hits $17 soon so I can do that
Whoever told me to sell calls so soon is an idiot, and I’m an idiot for listening to him, was up 103k on day few min ago but down 30k on the calls , shoulda waited till it was over $20 to sell them calls
No one knows the future. Congrats on your unrealized profit.
I sold $21 and then $22 contracts for 30k premium but if I waited a few more minutes would have been 40k, those calls are crazy!
How you feel now paper boy? 🤣
at least I made the day of whoever bought my calls earlier, we both win
You made bank fuck what anybody says lol good call
Oh you’re going to be a wealthy man if you hold.
$$$$$$$ today already. GL
Cant wait to do this with my life savings when I actually have money
So the math doesn’t add up. Return should be $12,482.00 not $12,000.00

Also, it says you profited, but the lines and datapoints are red. Normally when Robinhood displays a profit, the lines and datapoints are green.

I’m seeing this a lot. All of these photos people are posting are edited.

Maybe you didn’t know to edit that because you’ve never seen what Robinhood looks like when you make a profit?
20,000x.60=12,000
15.80 was still below 16 close yesterday which is why it was red lines
How can you be soo fucking wrong 😂😂
Nice
Beautiful
How are you doing? Must be happy
it shows profit of 170k but down 70k on the calls I sold against the shares :(

at least it's still a win
Why sell calls when it just tripled from $5 to $16, and that will create insane T + 2 gamma exposure.
Damn you’re rich now

Congratulations you earned it!! Now go out and celebrate. You and the wifey go to Applebee's and enjoy that 2 for $20.
Do you slap your own dick good sir!!?!?!?
Your IRS agent scrolling through 69,420 pages of forms going wtf.... wtf.... WTF???....
this guy has so many trades he has his own personal agent
This is why you hire agents on commission
This is why the IRS is useless. Hes doing the lords work
No wonder they are ‘use of deadly force’ authorized.  They are just getting the retards out of the stock exchange.

Let's go BBBY ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)
What does the green color mean?
Greatest all time? Maybe green swim trunks all day
My agent said with the loses I have, I dont have to pay taxes for a long time.
Well, since he said “loses” instead of “losses,” I wouldn’t expect much
Not with that Wendy's income you don't
You make less than $16k a year?
$16,500 GET IT RIGHT
Well, since he said “loses” instead of “losses,” I wouldn’t expect much
[deleted]
IRS doesn’t write tax laws, that is the work of the House and the Senate. They are justthe tax police
And Nancy is the Speaker of the House so her word is law. Welcome to democracy.
Not as bad as the last one at least Pelosi shows us what to buy...
Losses above $3000 can be deducted from future capital gains, it's not just $3000 per year. That number is specifically a deductable for income, not capital gains. If he has done his taxes properly he hasn't had to pay any additional taxes lol
For it to be a scam, they have to trick you. What the IRS does is called thievery.
Thieves
They are watermelon f@$kers
*writes this down in a journal labeled "things to absolutely definitely not do 😉"*
It me, watermelon 🍉.
"You've already moved on?" -🥥
Fell asleep
Companies and rich people gutting the IRS to skirt paying any taxes are the real thieves
How the fuck is a wealthy investor gutting the federally funded IRS?
Total scam

Post history full of copied comments
Don’t make them too mad. I heard  they carry 🔫s now.
If its a battle they want. A war i shall give.
They would make you punk.
Punk? Wtf are you even talking about? I sleep with a pump shotgun loaded with slugs... wtf are you gonna do? Pull a sword and give yourself unrealistic expectations?
They would make you get on your knees and punk.
Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees asshole maybe you arent willing to fight but i am.... i wont give up my guns nor my freedom to fight back.
There are a lot of decaffeinated brands on the market today that are just as tasty as the real thing.
Get on your knees and tell me you love me
No. I dont love you. Wouldnt say hate but maybe 1 ant step off of it. Id never get on my knees for someone whos so stupid as to think others will just "get on their knees for the government".. bitch the gov has pissed me off to the point where im fucking waiting for them to try some shit. And around here. Nobody will care about a gunshot so stfu before you learn whats at the bottom of the lake libtard piece of shit... I live by my gun ill damn well die by it
Holding that gun tight while you’re on your knees punking
Keep telling yourself that snowflake. Just because you would happily let the gov expand your throat doesnt mean everyone else will. Now please stop replying to this or ill block you for being an annoying little shit.
Taking this way too serious, you sound like an emotional snowflake, or what your kind would call “liberals”
No im just willing to stand up for what i believe in and know. Is he trolling. Probably. Idc. But im not going to be told id get on my knees and punk and not retaliate. Idgaf what your opionion is on the subject. Dunce
We’re talking about the IRS, they’re not gonna take your guns, just your taxes, you’re definitely gonna get on your knees and pay your dues
Idgaf who knocks at the door if its a federal agent of any kind they gon get federals
How can you stand up when you’ll be on your knees ?
They’ve been packing for over 25yrs.   Having been audited I can confirm this.
I would too, coming to audits some of these nut jobs...
Hope no one thinks to buy em bullets too...
Not to worry, **Funding Secured!**
Day traders making bank
$3 buying power?? That shits all in margin? No wonder why you only made $69. Too much interest
Real talk does someone at the IRS absolutely despise me for the dozens of cancelled trades I have on my account?  

I am, as one might say, *indecisive*.
Wait we gotta pay taxes for stocks 😳 I’ve been trading for a while now without reporting anything… any potential downside?
Good thing there will be 80,000 new agents armed and ready for action
His IRS agent gonna see a long list of losses then a huge gain on BBBY at the end, then he will look at my avatar and be like wow wow wow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)

Last year I brought in a stack of bank statements for all my trades to show a whopping $34 in gains for the year. The old lady looked at it and let out the saddest sigh I've ever heard in my life.
I think I know where he discovered options
Do you think he undiscovered them, or is on a path to complete account collapse?
Probably the ladder
then $ROPE
$ROPE for my neck or my portfolio?
Fucking short ladder attacks at it again
Definitely,
*Definately
But is it a DeWalt or a Werner ladder?
gonna be that guy in a friendly way

ladder is something you climb

latter is the final thing in a sequence, think like “the later one” but remember english is fuckin stupid
Yeah, i realized my mistake. I'm an idiot. Thanks
the first $69 is the hardest
Especially if she just had Taco Bell
this guy has insideher info
Happy Cake Day!

Or the time cost...
Or the health issues from years of stress
Or taxes
Or wifey
Or wifey’s boyfriend
Or aids
Or aid's wife's boyfriend
Or the tax fees require to submit the gain.
Capital gains tax is red, and wrong on so many levels.
Nah bro. Mad time lost
You are now more than $69 dollars above the average WSB return.
Great, keep it up and around 2030 you’ll be able to fill up 2 bags of groceries from the profit
With this inflation probably not lmao. Bananas will actually be $5 each.
So watermelon futures?
IRS wants to know your location
Location to your know IRS wants
Buying power $3.62... Why are you leaving the powder dry?? You could earn a few pennies at your earn rate if that was invested too
barely a penny
Look at Mr. Moneybags scoffing at making more money
with this inflation one penny doesn't even buy a minute with your wife's boyfriend's wife.
It does buy a timeshare though
And you get a free tote bag!
Sell and dump the rest into BBBY
This is where his gains came from anyway
Ah, then don’t sell
[removed]
This guy gets it.
Profit is profit. No one ever went broke making profit. Just remember that.
If it takes 7 years to make $69 on $30k, yeah, I think you could go broke when time to cash out given cost of living increases
Congrats and fuck you
Go for 70 and lose everything 🚀🚀🚀🚀
With BBBY?
I'm in the exact same boat
Proud of you
Niiiiice
When I hear... I'll never give up & I'll never surrender, I'll only think of you OP DDD at its best. LFG
🥲
Are you me?

Half my goal with BBBY was to make my 'all time earnings' finally go green after missing the train on GME
If you think you missed the train on GME, you haven't been paying as close of attention as you need 👀
He missed the train at the station but you can always catch it at the next stop...or you know just get to the queue for seats in the 🚀...not that far of a walk
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) just go put your money in a low-interest bank account, my dude. You would’ve come away with more.
At least you dident sell 2 months ago
Lesson here is never sell. A rising tide raises all ships.
What could you possibly have invested in during the greatest bull run we will probably ever see to make $69?
Still $69 more than your wife’s bf🙌
And her gf.
You mean to tell me you had 30k and went thru the biggest bull run in history and only made $69? You definitely belong here.
Congrats for the gain
Nice, see if you can bump it up to 420.
Charlie Sheen is proud of you. Winning so hard right now, bro.
Congrats and fuck you
Now all in BBBY
At least you clawed yourself out of the hole
[removed]
Didn’t even think about it like that. Yeah this is bad
This is hilarious lmfaomaoo
Your armed IRS agent will shoot you to put you out of your misery and gladly take your $69..

Ngl, the electricity costs every time you checked your account over those 7 long years is prolly more than $69. But you are still ahead of most of us
Now get out and be glad you made it out up
Nice
How 👀?  Can you share you method to success?
If you had learned from your mistakes within these 7 years, you could’ve made money. I have seen people who made 6 figs within 4 years by learning from their mistakes.
Why would I want to learn? That’s boring. I prefer pressing buttons after my shifts at Wendy’s.
Have you considered collecting cans? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
If you lost all but $69 worth of profits would’ve been one thing with the current market but How do you not make any money in a bull market lmao 

Traded out of all your gains

Our accounts are identical except I'm at 2k rn hoping this bbby yolo restores me to 30
420 is next, Champ!
What were the winning plays in the end?
Has robinhood been around for 7 years?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand its gone
I love you!
Atta boy!
That’s nearly $10/year…
Very handsome indeed 👏🏼
and 98 cents. Everybody talks about inflation but nobody talks about pennies.
Congrats, that's my favourite number!
Congrats and Fuck you
Let’s F***ing go 🚀
69. Sexy
Hey man at least your up 69$ good for you winning
Nice.
That's enough for you to retire buddy
Now that's some true gain porn
Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell
You made more than me in very short time. I’m still in negative.
Lend me some so you dont have so much, but you are better than me im negative 2k all time
👍
Should buy TSLA dude
Lol
I have felt your pain.
Don’t fomo, have conviction, do your DD.

Tomorrow you'll be up $420 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Hahahaha
Woohoo!!!
Well done mate
You would’ve been better off just sitting in a vanguard fund lmao
Sorry dude...  Don't know what to say.
Wrong. You made $69.98. Pre tax.
That's legendary diamond hands!!!
Boring graph
Green is green
Many blessings this is
Man I wish my portfolio was green.
Giggity
😎👏😎👏😎👏😎👏
Help me Master!
Damn you actually lost almost half your purchasing power from inflation though so big L
Are you positive you are in the green? Is it inflation adjusted?
Now you need to get to $420.69
I tell you from what I heard from the spirits that you are gonna get licky
You haven't made anything until you sell
This gives me hope
Hell yeah! Keep up the great work!
Not 69.420 ????
Nice
Proud of you
You are the man 👨 🙌 👏
How did you lose money in the bull market the last two years?
I am guessing OP was trading options 🤔
Jeez ...I just started investing in November and am up like 20%. I was down as much as 15% at a point, which didn't bother me much because most of my positions are long term. I also don't do options yet and only have like 5k invested so I know it's a different game. But so far I'm happy with it. Hey buddy at least you're in the green!
Nice
I made 30 bucks in 2 years
Cmon YOLO that $3.62 on some CGC!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Nice
Trust me, that guy is just an idiot. I turned $300 into about $900 within 2 weeks, it’s never like this if you’re somewhat competent.
Congrats and fuck you. I am also more incompetent OP is in the green. I'm still in the red.
I’m sorry lmao 😭.
No worries brosef. I am holding. Can't lose money if you never sell. Bought high just need to sell higher. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I hope the Chinese economic turmoil stimulates the markets to the moon.
He he OP said 69
Fuckin’ A
💎💎👏👏
Sweet gainz sir you can buy enough chicken tenders for you, your girlfriend, and your girlfriends boyfriend.
Fuckin A
Damn lol I been here a year and I’m still down $400+ haven’t really made profit at all 🤣 someone just needs to take my phone from me honestly 😅
This must not be full time trading
May be time to change investing strategies my boy.
Where can I get your book?
Nice
That’s almost $10/year. They make more in the Philippines.  I recommend moving there to become a T-Mobile representative.
A trade line that degrades that slowly and surely isn’t an easy accomplishment. Kudos my good man
Take your 30 gs out and invest in something better lol. Stocks aren’t your thing.
at least you’re not on red. lol
Stonks only go up 🚀🚀🚀(eventually)
#truebullrun
Bro, that's a double bottom pattern, it's gonna go up
Nice
I’m proud of you for sticking it out lol
This will be me Friday
probably should just put in savings account 🤣
LFG, 7 years in too, I'm still negative 12k+.
Damn bro chill.
Hey, you’re doing better than some people on this sub 😂
Worth it?

Heh. Nice.

Cheers brother! Almost back to even myself!
Take profits!! Or be a total retard and go all in BBBY
No way this is 7 years worth of investing. You have to have been doing something reall wrong not to make money between 2016 & 2021
You better pull your profits now! They will be gone before you know it haha! Also get that $3.62 invested asap homie!!
I made 27 cents
Hero

Congrats! I know that feeling
Nice
At least it’s green
Still better than the bank.
Man, take the money and run
OP should have just said he edged himself for 7 years straight and just now got off
I’m down 7.59% over 2.5 years. Up 63% the past month though
and you've got a bit more than tree fiddy to invest.
The 0.98 cent : am i a joke to you !?
Also if your poor or very low income they will wave or have pay extremely low capital gains percentage.  It's  A rare situation for someone to be working a poor job and making capital gains I know but I did it lol Heavy access to my grandma's money as her power of attorney and all that stuff trusty she died last year so anyways but I was able to do it making 9000 a year  I determined a shit load and my text person told me the last whatever text time that I had enough right offs of 3000 to last the rest of my lifetime )like 7 million)but but I did make some good gains on Tesla in 2019 yet paid nothing in capital gains
Then you are Stoopid!!
In the bright side of things, hope there are lessons to make you next 7 years 100x of the first 7years.
Congrats… I guess
You’re on a roll kid keep it up
Finally caught the dragon!
Excellent example for all those paper hand kids out there.
Take profit 🤣
Go shida Inu
If you did that without adding cash than nice work.

It’s all about the ride, not the destination.
Did yall see the emails coming in from Robinhood asking for personal information about where u work
Look at that war chest full of dry powder.
You guys are making money?
Congrats and fuck you, wish I was even lol, how did you recover?

How can I share with you all this serendipity?
The prophecy has come true!!
Get this man a watermelon 🍉
And lost 9% to inflation….. congrats?
Love this #Thisistheway
Pathetic
[deleted]
Idk.. does it auto calculate inflation
I bought a friends company stock at $20 per, sold it all at $40 per, then it tanked down to about $2.50 so I bought a boatload and just waiting for it to hit $40 again. Let’s ride.
Annnnnnnd you lost even more to inflation… lol
🫡
Nice
I’ll soon be joining you, hopefully. Still down by 12% overall. I had to change my entire options strategy.
Are you me? That looks too similar to my graph lmao
Proud
So I have a question since I'm not the greatest when it comes to taxes and write offs and things like that are you able to write off a portion of your losses for a tax break? My coinbase account is down about a good party weekend, but I'm really not down. I made a bunch of money with different tokens and nfts and then transferred some of that to my coinbase account and purposely took small losses to record a negative for the year. So now could I write some of that off as a loss for the year? Or did I just throw money away like a real ass hat
Now quit
Nice!
Good , better than loss
NOICE
It’s hard to hear but a standard savings account would yielded more
Nice
Not to late to the moon with BBBY bro!!!
After 7 year if you see some gain in this market that means you did really well. Because most of the folks are not getting any returns in this market.
What? Did you think this life was easy? Oh, no boss, make own hours, gamble for a living and make it all look easy, etc.? Really?
Well OP at least you can say, unlike the vast majority of WSB, that you have made a profit.
Congratulations, brother. You've already almost turned that $69 into $70. Imagine where you'll be in 30 years. Probably like $100.
nice
Look, it's 69... You done good. I approve of your degeneracy
Time to take your profit. 🤝
Looks like you've hit a purple vein
I see the problem.

You’re using Robinhood.
SIXTY-NINNNNNNNNE!!!
Another 7 more years and you'll get 420
Yay!   You did make me feel better about my gains…
Bro, you didn't make shit. You lost out to inflation. Sorry i had to break it to you.
Hope this not gonna be another. Can you tell when I discovered options? Post
Well I've lost about $100,000 in 2 years, so go fuck yourself
You made onto tiktok
So -50% after inflation
After inflation….. you’re still red
GG
Me too
Why did you buy Kodak, Packard Bell and Yugo in the first place?
better than making -$ after 7 years
Bruh, you're almost at $70.
Stonks! 📈
Nice
Niceeee
Fuck yeah dude
Way to bag hold 🤙🏻
Congrats - you big dummy
You made -50% compared to the SP500 though
What are you doing i have some stocks who pay dividend and i got more than you in 5 months lol
Yoooo... You actually made it! You became profitable! That is amazing! Please, teach me senpai!
Good for you 😀👍🤞
Cash out and head to Applebee’s. You’ve earned it.
Congratulations slow and steady lose the race 👍🏼
Before inflation.
Congratulations. At last you made it. 🤣🤣🤣
How much after 7 years inflation
great ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)
Adjust for inflation and post again.
On dad midh send c c we exrx e n tax cf?8 kuz you i
Lucky you, I'm still down 69%
Don’t spend it all at once
Be careful if IRS agent has to spend more than 100 hours checking your tax returns, and government can only collect under 5000$ for that year, the IRS is legally allowed to terminate you.
I literally have made more this year just doing dollar day trades on crypto….
Dangerous close to 70 ...
if you’d only kept that 30K in VTI you would’ve 10xd plus dividends
It’s time to cash it in!!!
You did it!
Good job man! You drove that shit straight into the mud almost loosing it all only to turn it around and drive back out ! Good for you.
A monkey throwing darts would've done better.
*snips*

‚bring in the hookers and coke‘
Niiiiice
No need to brag!
Imagine robinhood ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
It's good, isn't it? Through your own research and the management of the broker, with your cooperation, used 7 years to generate a high income of $69 for yourself, why not relax by inviting your broker on a fun trip now Come on, or have an elaborate AK mutual sweep with your agent?
Nice
Did you break even on Options?
im slowly coming back from the red hell too
You need to join winright.novatechfx.com/enroll I make 10-12% monthly. Payouts weekly.
Back in 2005, I did a few trades on a friends account, it was basically a wash so he didn't bother reporting it. That was a mistake. Because of the sales, the IRS sent him a bill as if he had made $200K. He got it straightened out pretty easily though.
this guy has diamond hands
HODL until $420!!!
Nice
Proud of you. Now you're just one yolo away from beating the market
That's great. I need to show this to my kids to prove that good things do come to those that wait.
GREEN IS GREEN! Congrats!
God damn this is painful.
You're journey is now complete

That’d be okay
Let me be serious for a second here. Went in for 50 shares, could not afford more. But holy shit these gains are such a relief for a middle class ape like me.

With that said, screw the moon. Where we going, we don't need roads! To another solar system and beyond!
My 11.5 calls already up 280%. Its tempting to sell but we'll see where this goes.

Like a fox
3) Panic sell at $15.
4) Price jumps to $40.
Are you me?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4263)
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
This one got me good😆
Are you you or are you me or am I you?
That’s what I did. That first drop after $15 I was like "these fucking reddit idiots…" and sold it all. 

I tell myself "it was only 16 shares" and "I still made money" but it stings a little.
Bro we got to 14.30 today and I thought hmm, better tuck away a bit of my winnings and sold about 20% of my shares, looked at my phone half an hour later and kicked myself
I was in at 12. Woke up at 3am. Thought "hmm ill sell at this 15, nice" then said "wait, no. Reddit can do better. 16.80 Limit." Slept again.

Woke up and got the sell and holding leftover shares for moon. My thought rn? Reddit, wsb, bbby, gme, rc, all holders can still do much much better.
Got in at $4.63 in July and took a little profit (something I didn't do with GME) when it hit $15 this afternoon (5% of my position). I knew I should have waited for more, but being a dumb GME ape I need to figure out how to set up an exit plan (or how to even sell).
Good for you you paper handed bish
Dude. I bought 130 $7 calls when the Stock price was $5.90. IV was low, below 100%. 

I sold the majority at a 50% gain. You know what they percent they were a week later?


941%.
You're wasting your time buying 16 shares. You could buy a call for 100 shares with the same money.
How do you do that without knowing anything about decay and all that other crazy shit and still make money? 🤔🤔🤔
You dont
I lost a ton not fully understanding options lol. I am getting better and have also played more conservatively. My one $9 C on BBBY for 9/23 looks real juicy right now lol but I just bought one 😭
I lost 20k over 3 years, then made 1.3M from GME options.

Dont give up lol
I made 4k, then lost 14k, haven’t traded in months.
Ahh good times!
This warms my heart thanks for the encouragement lol
Dude, fuck yeah.
How much of that is left and of that, how much is in BBBY?
What does $9 C exp 9/23 mean like hows that make you cash cash cash?
I bought a call option last week. Options are essentially bets, like truly a casino.  So I was betting that BBBY would be above $9 on the date 9/23. The more likely that seems like it’s happening the more money your option makes. But your options also lose money based on time decay. 

If your option isn’t in the money by that date it’s worth $0. Within a week or two if it doesn’t look likely will also be basically worth $0. If it’s out the money time decay will destroy it 

I bought the option when it was like right around $9. Had I waited til it dropped more I would have gotten it cheaper. Since BBBY is much higher today the option is worth a lot more. Paid like $$335 for it and it’s worth roughly $850
You're essentially buying the option to buy shares at 9 bucks right, and then you sell that option to someone else? What happens if time is up and you didn't sell it? Also how the f do you figure out decay that seems to be the hard part 😂
if time is up and you didn't sell it, it's worth exactly $0. you also have the option to exercise it, meaning you execute the "option" to buy 100 shares at the strike price per option contract, in this case $9.

you make mad money on options when the stock goes way in your favor and the option to buy at the strike price is worth a lot more than what you paid for it.

most people here seem to wait until the "time up" part of the option and lose everything, though YMMV lol.
No it's not worth 0 if it's ITM
Yeah I don't get the time up part haha like can you set it to auto sell before you get fucked? Does Theta hurt less the further out the strike date? I need to study haha.
The other guy answered the previous part but time decay is “theta”.
I've seen that word! Pretty sure I'd still fuck it up somehow haha. Is there a way to do options without margin so you have a max you can lose?
Yeah just get your account approved for options, I don’t use margin
Oh I see. There's no way this can go tits up!
Lol you’ll just blow through money you have rather than money borrowed 😂
Annnnnnnd it's gone....
Yeah that's why I never did haha
Well, you could spend 5 minutes reading about options…
5 minutes.... 
That's funny 😄
But I'm retard
Maybe he lives in Europe where trading options isn't allowed to anyone with a phone.
Wait till you be in debt. I don’t think you understand options and your obligations.
Lol, buying an option doesn't come with any obligation, noob. That's the entire point.
Good for you. Keep going keeeeep going buddy keep it. Waiting for your post with $1000000 debt.
When you buy a call or put option, you can just let it expire. You don't owe anything, you ape.
Lmao, you don't understand how options work.
Okay yeah whatever.
Paper-handed pussy.
I slept in when it went from 8 to 10, kicking myself for waiting until now to finally jump in only *after* it went from 13 to 16.
Profit is profit and bagholders are a result of being too greedy. Sold 80% of mine off for 115% gain and no regrets about taking a gain.
Always hodl till we land on the moon, then keep hodling until Mars 🚀🚀👽👽
I don't think this can so what gme did because surely the forces that lost control of gme two years ago have figured out a way to stop a runup of that nature but I believe in a range from $40 to $100 enough to not get scared off by drops.
It's not going to be gme purely cause you won't get a bunch of normal people seeing it 140% short in the news. I think people under estimate how much random people just jumped in cause of how much it was shown even in the news.

With that said no reason this doesn't do extremely well.
More random people jumped in on GME but more retards bought more shares in anticipation of a GME-like run here so who knows what can happen
Also boomers might want a ride this time
I think people are missing the point on gme, big money was behind that. You had other firms that saw Melvin was in trouble and cut them out by the knees. You did a $20K Yolo and other firms dropped $20M
Whoever you guys running this scam are you're brilliant
Which is exactly what’s going to happen 😂
Yep 100% me sold all mine during the "first squeeze" when it shot to almost $13 and dropped to $9. Not temped with FOMO to try again.
Everytime you sell price goes up
This is the way of being a little fund manager in degen street
Student loans are deferred. Fuck it. YOLO!
This is the way!
Might as well, Biden will forgive it, anyyy day now
Just going to be suspended until 2024 with 4 month intervals renewing at the last minute to give the illusion that it's being carefully studied. https://www.intelligent.com/1-in-5-democrats-wont-vote-for-biden-in-2024-if-he-doesnt-forgive-student-loans/
Partial/10k forgiveness close to midterms because “he promised.”
yeah they're seeing what can get passed/done before they do this.

One person owing another money, and profit being made from that is the IRON LAW of AMERICA. Debt and profit.

Just yoinking that away from the people who stood to make money off the interest/servicing is going to cause a level or reeeeeeing by the rich we haven't seen for a while.

Also, people that have paid off their loans within the last 5-8 years are gonna be pissed that they missed out on it, just by paying diligently, so they will reeeeeee as well, unless there is a tax credit program put in, which there wont be.

downvoted without a counterpoint. cowards
The funny part about the downvote is that you’re exactly right. There’s a TON of profit made by the banks off student loans. Complete forgiveness even if we made those a tax write off for the banks would be a disaster for those banks.
Fuuuck I just realized I’m missing out on easy 100% gainz.. I need to pick up some student loan debt so papa Biden can pay it off
You are a fucking regard.
When Biden pays for your BBBY shares
It better not, that's some serious bullshit the rest of the country has to eat.
He needs to forgive all student federal loan debt. Fucking people need help.
Sure but only if my mortgage gets forgiven too
Since when was there another deferment? I was called by student loan company a month or so ago saying we had to start paying again in October.
There’s been no announcement. However the CARES act required 6 notifications before restarting payments. Idk about you, but I’ve received none outside of MSM. As far as I know that requirement is still active.
I don't have any student loans myself,  but I really hope y'all have the debt cancelled. I saw what student loan interest did to my parents finances,  and the thought of it being a national issue is alarming. Those loans are so predatory it's ridiculous.

Autocorrect gives us all way too much credit with that one.
It’s not autocorrect, people are purposefully typing that because they’re trying to turn this sub into a safe space or some shit
What sort of inflammatory bullshit are you spouting? 

It's getting used because reddit mods (not SUB mods) keep banning people for using the other word. If anything people are trying to keep this a NOT safe space, by refusing to stop using the word (It's impossible to not infer the meaning by context)
You so regarded!!
i must be properly regarded then, i fomo in at $16 haha
[clearly, TeRarded](https://imgur.com/a/5KnjPVs)
Regurgitated
Come back when it's $48 and people are still buying.

You guys make me proud.
I feel like all of the people lately writing regarded instead of retarded just solidifies the density around hear.
>density around hear

Never change, WSB. I see now why you're all so highly regarded.
I’m sick of this political censorship!!! I can call myself a retard if I want to!!!
I identify as a regard and if you don’t agree with me then you’re racist
This guy regards
I was permanently banned from Reddit on my other account for calling someone regarded with t here.
Just say returded. Double insult
Tegarded?
Said by none other than Phteven himself
It’s stupid as shit and sounds like typical 15 year shit. Just say redarded u fucks.

edit/redarded*
They are quite literally handing out site wide permanent bans for using that word.

You are literally a report away from taking a dirt nap and becoming another 1 day old account that everyone ignores.
Recently had reddit ads on the radio. Guess they are trying to make it user friendly even when they have some fuvked up groups
They are trying to clean it up before going public.
well damn, looks like im in the redard boat.
Shit I guess I need to stop saying it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
What? Is that really true? I thought that apart from classic "hate crimes", subreddit owners can basically goveen their sub however they like?

I'd understand a subreddit ban, but globally? For a relatively tame insult? That's too much.
Its absolutely true.

And no they are well past letting subs curate themselves, they want the entire site cleaned up and as part of it certain disparaging words are a 1 way ticket to permabans.
I just had a 3 day Reddit ban for telling someone that they were “pathetic”

Obviously Reddit hates me.
Obviously you called someone under the protected class of people pathetic.  You’ll need to target the right group of people next time to get your social credit points back
I thought people were all having common typing issues.
They come from r/wallstretbets
>I feel like all of the people lately writing regarded instead of retarded just solidifies the density around hear.
>>hear
The dude regards.
I was watching BBBY from even before those bad earnings waiting for a time to buy. I was waiting because I thought after the current bear market rally we are in ended, the price would drop more. However, the price just rocketed after the insiders bought, and kept going up. Then i fomoed in at around 12 dollars last monday....right before the 30% drop. I wanted to french kiss an oncoming train.....shouldve just bought when insider bought.....
The kind of loan that gets cancelled?
17’s better than when its at 350 boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis
Momentum investors don't buy at the bottom, they move with the apes
Ah yes investors
Investing is what I did before I came here. Believe it or not I was so bad at investing that my meme stock positions have been MUCH more profitable.
In at 12.25. 3/4 regarded?
anything less than $15 is below ryan cohens initial cost basis for shares, anything below $80 is below his strike price to exercise his Jan 2023 calls. We looking lambo gainz bro, don't worry.
De definitely.  He has some $60 calls for Jan 23 too
Another ape that thinks $80 calls means RC expects $80 ticker prices.
Explain?
An $80 call if bought far enough out and with low volatility at the time of purchase doesn't only become profitable if the ticker hits the strike price. 

It doesn't necessarily signal that RC has confidence that BBBY will be hitting $80.
[removed]
With all the hype around it I feel comfortable waiting till $80. Or zero. Whatever comes first. To sell that is.
I bought options as soon as it hit the bottom. I was like, this shit is cheap.
hey, that's me tomorrow
 Tbf I didn’t see massive posts of DD till after it popped. Y’all gotta get this stuff out before they run next time
Market cap and rules of the sub - if it falls back down, we won’t be able to mention it again.
Well that seems to defeat the purpose
The degens sold at loss and some took profits at 13 is probably pray it would collapse ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Buy high sell low bb
THE MASTER PLAN OF  RYAN COHEN RC VENTURES : Rise the cap market of BBBY to be equal to GameStop and then merge BBBY with GME to form a new bigger company called GMERICA: Warehouse of BBBY will be used as fulfillment centers, Stores of BBBY will be used as distribution centers and GameStop market place will be used as method of payment by Blockchain for all transactions to compete with Amazon. We are witnessing the formation of the Biggest Corporation in the World (Merger between 
$BBBY
 and 
$GME
 : Most of the executives at GME joined from Amazon. THIS IS HUGE 
- You guys remember on July 7th CFO Mike Recupero was said not fit at GameStop? He was released to take the position of CEO at BBBY and that’s legal and not conflicting with the Business Agreement signed of standstill signed between Ryan Cohen and Bed Bath & Beyond.
This is smooth brained thinking to the max. I'm in.
Bro, my tits can only be so jacked
[removed]
Regarded like a fox
How much higher do people realistically expect BBBY to go?
I think 25 because it was the old peak and people will panic sell
1000$
Anyone who bought at $16+, y’all are the true MVPs
There’s gonna be people buying all the way up to the previous 6 month high of 27.23. There’s gonna be a few sell offs before then along the way as the paper hands take their profits, but I think people are just gonna keep jumping in. But what do I know, I’m just your average regarded ape.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Could I ask you what that means? I keep seeing people posting those.
“Your right you know”
I see I see, gracias.

HODOR
$4.50 checking in
They are definitely regarded as retarded
said r word =O
Shut up retard
More like take out a 27k loan, bought in at $11 just to paper handed at $9!
New student loan forgiveness program, due to:

You're regarded
Very well regarded thank you very much.
I did both ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Stop saying regarded you stupid morans!
Who brought at $17?
I had $5.50 Calls that expired worthless because of those earnings lol. 

And I hopped on again with just ONE call on this…..gonna add some more tmmrw.
Or be like me bought at 5 something 2 days before earnings, seen earnings, immediately exited position at 20% loss. Then notice wsb pumping it like 2 weeks later, and kicking myself in the bung hole and ignoring it for a couple days, bought a 14$ call, rolled it when it doubled overnight to a $25c 08/26 and held today. Almost sold when it doubled up, but going to hold and see what happens tomorrow. Probably gonna roll this when it hits 300% to the jan 23 80c and let the IV beat the theta in the short term and hopefully exit before wsb forgets about it for a little bit. This meteoric rise has to plateau at some point like gme did  and occasionally spike 50% in a week, followed by months of steady bleed. I don't think Its too late to buy shares, I would just have to exit other positions that I'm not willing to right now. Might exercise the call if it goes in the money.
Looking for the earnings thread? 

You can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread. I also try to sticky it between 8am and 10am, as well as 2pm to 6pm every trading day. 

The earnings thread is sometimes unpinned so that other underappreciated WSB posts can be stickied. This hopefully gives the subreddit more variety and makes it more interesting for you. 

I apologize for the inconvenience of having to click into the daily thread first. We're just trying to make it look more like the good old days. 

Help us get the word out, tell people where to find the earnings thread when they ask, as well as why we sticky low karma, high effort, threads!

This is the way!
😂😂😂😂 I go on Reddit for posts like this! Best way to start my day!
Glad to put a smile on that regarded face
Traded some options on the pump, made a easy 30%-50% depending on contract.. 

More than happy for my taste. Usually stay out of the memers but couldn’t resist
Yup same, I just kept going in and out. Love days like this. They don’t come around much
Let’s Gooooo
This aged like fiiiine wine
As intended
I made 70k on BBBY
Nice! 👍🏻
Highly refarded
In at about 12.50. I waited to make sure shit was getting real but didn't want to wait so long it was regarded. I feel like it was a good sweet spot but we'll see...
regards will be FOMO’ing in at $200. i know, because a long time ago i FOMO’d into gme at $355. an absolutely asinine play made by yours truly
Yes and we’re making money
Is it a bad time to jump in now? I feel like it’s going to rocket by Friday.
Just get in NFA
Just put money you’re ok with losing. Then if it doubles or triples or quadruples or quintuples, Sell.
Idk 17 sounds like a discount before the moas
Regarded as what?
WSB sends their regards.
Living through this after seeing all the win (whats the oppisite of porn)
Marriage
This hits lol
That’s me. 🚀
This is the way. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
How about yoloing all my extra cash at $10.71
What else do you expect?
Where did *regarded* come from
Showing regard for your fellow apes
Reddit has been cracking down more and more on our favorite word so we now move over to similar sounding ones such as regarded
It was a typo in another popular thread about BBBY here and seems ho have been adopted.
3b?  1y....?
This is life.
Oooh drakey tell em
I did the same thing lol … this is the way
No regurts….
I bought at $5 after RC buying and the earnings were shit, I deadass sold a day before the run up to $9
Better late than never
Got a share for 15.85 or somethin earlier today, I'm gonna take a look at it now :)
Im something of an aurtist myself
You damn regards
Hey I’ve made regardeder decisions so I can’t talk shit
For 1 second of fame
My biggest tax lot was bought at 4.55 😎
Excuse me sir. I YOLO'd everything at $14
The hilarity never ends
Dis don’t regard me
I like to think I am highly regarded…
*highly* regarded
Thank you. I do believe that I am regarded highly.
I mean, def not wrong and I’m fkn here for it ayyyy let’s go
😂😂 shiiiie I’m sayin
At least we can spell retarded
Never trade meme stocks with loans.
Send my regards
I wanted to bank account to be regarded with WSB deposits
To go balls deep thou must have balls!
Why are you making memes about me? I feel so called out rn lmao
true regard here, but what does FOMO stand for?
Fear Of Missing Out
Fear of Monster owls
To play Devil’s advocate, I know many people who only buy at highs while panic selling at lows, and they don’t belong to WSB.
if we were normal, we wouldn't be here.![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Just wishing I'd invested more than 300 bucks....when you see a profit of 45%.... it creates the what if scenario in your head. 
Still 150 profit is a few large Leo's in Thailand... so all good...
Who gives a fuck apes. This thing is going to a 40B marketcap just like GME and AMC did. The price target is $640. 

Every non-ape can lick my elbow sweat.
I’m quite proud that I bought 6 shares at $4.55 with whatever money I had left from my other investment
You are truely regarded
Instructions clear, YOLO all savings in $BBBY
One of us, one of us, googa gabba, gooba gobble.
I am regarded, check.
I bought yesterday but just got my check gonna buy today😈😈
Nah I bought BBBY shares at $7, earnings sucked, I panicked and sold ~$5. Watched BBBY go up to 15
F
Bought 290 more. Now I own 570. To the moon!
I am regarded
#truth

See you all in BBBY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Can’t be a legend if you don’t risk it all.
Bought 400 bbby last Thursday sold yesterday waiting for a quick dip
I yoloed my student loans yesterday at $14.5
Ryan Cohen has call options at 60 and 80 for bbby... soo..... yolo
Hey I bought 60 at 8! Then 80 more a little bit ago…
I'm doing the moon walk in Timberlands!
I'm doing the moon walk in Timberlands!
I'm doing the moon walk in Timberlands!
Bro I sold my $5 put on bbby last week when the stock price was at $6. It’s the worst decision I’ve ever done in my life.
I wish I could buy more at $17…
I'm doing the moon walk in Timberlands...pretty sure I have no business wearing them or dancing.
Wait, I got a car loan than I can’t really afford. The car is also kind of useless to me now. After 4 years, I decided I like riding a bike better. Will my car loan be deferred too?

Edit: god damnit I meant to reply to a comment not post my own. Fuck it, read and figure it out you regards

After hours not looking good

We are gambling here like in a casino, no one cares to furure of bbby or any other stock. Hedges should split with us what they earned since years
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.
I’ve put all my chips on RC. 

Man’s gonna change the world, hope he sends me my 0.01%. 🤪
i just put fucking 200 more into BBBY. To the fucking moons boys. HODL
2k this morning.
20k this morning
1k Here for the ride
$73 in!
$73 in!
$73 in!
$73 in!
$73 in!
How much did you put in?
$200 today all together. Lol. I'm poor.
It was a joke. You’ve mentioned 7e dollars like 10 times that’s why ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Oh! I tried going back to fix that but the comments weren't showing up. Reddit posted it then froze me out.
Ahhh no worries bro. Hope we get rich.
Me too man! I'm enjoying this so far!
How old are u bro
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
80+ easily not including a squeeze
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I'm so fucked .
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
Buy the dip
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
A pure gamble, could work though
That’s… why we’re here
You're being sarcastic I think, but RC's whole agenda is, and he's laid this out for all to see:

1. sell buy buy Baby
2. use some of that money to restructure debt and try to stop losing so much money with inventory problems
3. use the rest of the baby money to 'reduce outstanding shares' (buyback)
4. dump the bags on someone else to take private(not in those exact words)

So he wants to turn it around enough to not go bankrupt and get shareholders paid, but there's also a reason he only follows Gamestop on twitter still.
The old management tried the same thing when they sold Christmas Tree Shops and some other business. It gave them some money to prop up the rest of the company for a little while and now it’s gone and the Bed Bath & Beyond stores are still deserted, sad places.

So the NEW super-duper plan is to sell off the Baby stores to give them some money to
prop up the rest of the company for a little while..

 INNOVATIVE!!
I’ve never been a fan of “distraction” memes but this one sure feels like it. I’ve got a feeling a strong GME run is coming in September
Would be a lot cooler if I ran now
!remindme 1 month
I sure hope so because I don’t like the way this feels as a GME holder and zero in BBBY, all of my $ is tied up in GME & LRC
I want 30-35 b mkt cap!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️

Maybe I can dave a little to pay a bunch of people to beat the fuck out of me.
Positions or ban
Nobody is worried here.
THE COMPANY JUST WENT BACK TO RC’S NORMAL VALUATION. Nothing excessive has happened yet! It starts now!
This is *not* a turnaround play. I don’t know how high it will squeeze, but If you hold too long, you will regret it.

Ryan Cohen did wonders for GME stock, but he hasn’t done as much for GameStop as a company. Let’s look at his accomplishments:

- Raised money by issuing stock after run-up (good job)
- Brought in talent from big tech/Chewy. Many of these new hires were over-promoted to lure them over. Others were being “managed out” of their former positions
- Increased warehouse capacity/improved logistics. This is fine, but it represents doubling down on physical goods (a shrinking segment with lots of competitors)
- Opening NFT marketplace. A desperate, poorly-timed attempt to attach GameStop to a current buzzword. Instead of a major new revenue stream, looks like a possible money loser. Game publishers have said “thanks, but no thanks”
- Bought 100k shares (on top of 9 million), to get retail regards pumped after poor earnings. This blatant psychological trick worked brilliantly
- Stock split. Again, a smart exploitation of retail investor psychology, and wildly successful

These $60 and $80 BBBY calls are right out of the retail manipulation playbook. Brilliant, but more about signaling than actual belief.

Does this mean BBBY can’t squeeze? Absolutely not. Just remember that it will drop back to earth quickly. This is a pump and dump that turned into a squeeze, so don’t get greedy.
What did Ryan Cohen actually achieve with GME? Opening an NFT site that nobody uses?
Don’t forget the stock split (as a “dividend”, lol).

He is great at manipulating regards to pump the stock. Not so great at turning companies around.
Yup
Because we give 2 actual shits what Cohen think? Fuck him, fuck the hedgies and DD BBBY with me, rarteds. ALL APES ABOARD FOR THE MOON AND B-B-B-Y-BEYOND!
Buying more 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bbby furnishings in nft format for use in metaverse. It’s the obvious play
The position is long, strong, and down to get the FRICTION on 🔥🚀💎
You are going to die poor.  This is a shit company whose stock is getting squeezed because it got over shorted - because it's a shit company.

Ryan Cohen is not corporate Jesus sent to atone for the sins of the Wall Street fat cats.  He is an investor looking out for his own interests. 

I suggest you do the same.

He's already made a lot of money on his play, and once he feels he has made enough, he will close his positions, the "apes" will all lose their nerve, and this stock will plummet back to single digit price so fast it will make your head spin.
Laughable, honestly. Have you lost your damn mind? After this occurence the company will be gently sat on a corperate fuck tonne of liquid... and with this they will be able to drink. Then again, who truly know the penultimate outcome of all this absurdity. You? Most certainly not. Me? Fuck no. We are all stragglers trying to flourish and bloom right? Wrong. we are melon kuni
Can’t collect retirement money until like 64 either way 🚀
Whay has Cohen actually accomplished at Gamestop?  What transformation has he done to the stores, or significant new revenue streams been created?  I don’t mean future pie-in-the -sky promises, but actual new sales revenue coming in.
He's accomplished exactly jack shit.
So you’re telling me not only can I get the lushes 2000 thread count 100% Hotel grade Egyptian Pima Cotton bedsheets in a California King, now I’ll be able to get them in an NFT as well?!?
I’ve put my money on black.
800 more shares purchased. Let’s go
fuck it. pass the crayons
You dicks are gonna bankrupt me! I'm in fuck it boys we doin it again!!!
bUt cRamER SaiD tO sELL?!

BBBY literally is the GME from January 2021
GME is still not a good company. It's just riding a retard wave. It's a storefront of things that can be bought online.
Hope is all lost.  It's fucking over we lost again.
It diped 4 bucks last week then went up 8, idk what you taking bout
About a 5% dip that will gain momentum and open -10% or more and my account getting blown the fuck up at opening bell.
$BBBY went up nearly 25% yesterday, what are you smoking?
Are you looking at the same ticker bro?cause bbby is on launch mode
Please sell your shares, I‘ll take em

Can’t wait for your EOD post so so can jerk off to someone else’s amazing gains. I’m in at $7.01 but only have 75 shares.

Good thing Im retarded and get my financial advice from memes
That means your inverse retarded
🤣😭
Hedgies are at work trying to reduce there losses
Oh shit! I should sell?!? Weird because there was a 23% gain yesterday and an 8% gain so far today. Im a mental midget compared to Forest Gump so I must be doing this wrong. I was going to sell when we landed on the moon. Well I guess I’ve already lost out. Guess I’ll hold the rest of the way.
*30%
70*
This sounds like the Streisand Effect hard at work
Hahaha, apes together strong
I can't read
Relatable
[removed]
Buff your attack with DRS and your defense with Shop.
I can’t believe they are still using boomer methods to beat us. Do they not have any idea how retarded we are?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|8881)
I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING! LETS GOOOO 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My dick is so hard right now it hurts.
viagra overdose?
Nice try but we tarded to the moon
So green is now the new definition of pull back
It was down 4% when they released it 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 that’s like .0000001% in meme stock terms
Lol as if anyone cares what “analysts” think
Too bad, i just like the stock
Hahahahaha, thanks for the hot tip CNBC!
Hurry and buy puts 🤡🤡 lmfaoooo
If there is anything to learn from WSB its that FUD means BUY! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258). Where that squeeze bot at?
I should have been paying a little more attention and started snagging some up around 8/9 per share.
Clowns
I mean with all the hit pieces suddenly could you make it any more obvious that you are trying to bail out hedgies?
We’re veterans now and have seen their playbook, nothing can stop retarded apes this time
To the moon!
Lolz-ing in $28
I’m up 2200%

Just wanna see how high that number will go.
It will go up until expiration.
I can't believe thoes clowns shorted it to 5 as if they never heard of gme 😆 or papa Cohen..
Greedy schmucks
Literally up 500%. Think I’ll just see where this goes
Dees nutz
All these news articles saying negative things about our stocks just cause us to hype and ape in more
